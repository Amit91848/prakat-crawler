I came down with Covid for the second time last week, and it left me shivering, sweating, panting a little, unable to sleep, unable to get out of bed. I watched things on my screens. I drank a lot of Gatorade and swallowed my dose of Paxlovid in the mornings and at night. I ate little. I kept panic about my breathlessness at bay. It was not a good time.I thought a lot about what I was going to cook, and eat, once I got better. These were spacey fever dreams. High on the list: Bryan Washington\u2019s new recipe for chilaquiles verdes (above), which he wrote about for The New York Times Magazine.What I love about the recipe, and about Bryan\u2019s cooking in general, is his understanding of how recipes aren\u2019t rules so much as guideposts, ways of thinking about dishes that can mutate over time, perhaps because of circumstance or taste. There are a thousand ways to make chilaquiles, after all, and in Bryan\u2019s view, the best way is the way the dish was prepared the last time he ate it. \u201cLike so much of cooking\u2019s calculus,\u201d he said, \u201cchilaquiles are as much about feel as about measurements and instructions.\u201d______Featured RecipeChilaquiles VerdesView Recipe \u2192______So attend to his recipe, and make it your own. Excellent tortillas help, as does time spent making the salsa verde with care. But I\u2019ll tell you what: You could make chilaquiles with store-bought tortilla chips and a jar of your favorite salsa verde (mine\u2019s from Herdez) and feel a wonderment, especially if you\u2019ve been laid low and are just trying to find a sense of the delicious.Then keep it up. I\u2019d like to make our recipe for the best chicken salad this weekend, for lunches next week, and kimchi carbonara for Saturday night, if not clam fritters and coleslaw. Some have asked if they can use canned chopped clams for those fritters. You can, but before you do, see if your fishmonger has frozen chopped clams \u2014 the true middle ground between fresh and preserved.And grilled chicken with tomatoes and corn for dinner on Sunday night? I\u2019d like that, though if I\u2019ve got the energy (I\u2019m still a little shaky!), I\u2019d almost prefer a celery Victor salad, with cold slices of watermelon for dessert.There are many thousands more recipes to cook this weekend, waiting for you on New York Times Cooking, at least if you have a subscription. Subscriptions support our work and make it possible to continue. I hope if you haven\u2019t taken one out already, that you will subscribe today. Thank you.If you run into problems with our technology, please reach out for help: cookingcare@NYTimes.com. Someone will get back to you. Or if you\u2019d like to lodge a complaint or offer a compliment to one of our hard-working staff members, you can write to me: foodeditor@NYTimes.com. I can\u2019t respond to every letter. I get a lot of them. But I do read every one I receive.Now, it has nothing to do with beurre blanc or ripe blackberries, but after I rewatched Michael Mann\u2019s 1995 thriller, \u201cHeat,\u201d with a 103-degree fever, his novel \u201cHeat 2\u201d made a lot more sense to me. (I caught the film on Netflix; it\u2019s on other streaming services as well.)Are you caught up on Steven Soderbergh\u2019s \u201cFull Circle\u201d on Max? Y\u2019oughta get on that. It took me down a Soderbergh rabbit hole to his excellent \u201cCommand Z,\u201d written with Kurt Andersen, on their very own website.Finally, here\u2019s my anthem this week, the song that kept me going: \u201cStill Getting It Done,\u201d from Ghost of Vroom. I\u2019ll see you on Sunday.Read MoreEggplant ParmesanEric Kim1 hour 35 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.Soy-Glazed Salmon Hand RollsKay Chun30 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easySheet-Pan Chicken Thighs With Spicy CornMelissa Clark55 minutes, plus at least 30 minutes\u2019 marinatingSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyBlistered Broccoli Pasta With Walnuts, Pecorino and MintDawn Perry15 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyTomato Cheddar ToastsAli Slagle10 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.Pork Ribs AdoboJulia Moskin, Amy Besa, Romy Dorotan1 hour 30 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyChilled Zucchini Soup With Lemon and BasilHetty Lui McKinnon15 minutes, plus optional chillingSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyPeach CrispYossy ArefiAbout 2 hoursSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyChilaquiles VerdesBryan Washington20 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.Best Chicken SaladJulia Moskin20 minutes, plus 2 hours' resting and 4 hours' chillingSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.Kimchi CarbonaraElyse Inamine, Melanie Hye Jin Meyer25 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyColeslawKay Chun10 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyCoconut-Dill Salmon With Green Beans and CornYewande Komolafe40 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyGrilled Pork Chops With Plum BBQ SauceEric Kim30 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyBaked Feta Dip With Spicy Tomatoes and HoneyMelissa Clark1 hour 20 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.Nonalcoholic Dirty Lemon TonicRebekah Peppler5 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.Moka Dupont: A French Icebox CakeDorie Greenspan30 minutes, plus at least 3 hours chillingSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyOvernight OatsGenevieve Ko5 minutes, plus overnight soakingSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.Slow Cooker Chipotle-Honey Chicken TacosSarah DiGregorio3 to 5 hoursSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.healthyThai-Style Crunchy Vegetable SaladKay Chun20 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.See all recipes Recipes We Think You\u2019ll LoveDishes recommended for you based on what you\u2019ve savedTrending RecipesMore From Our EditorsWeeknight dinners, seasonal favorites and other ideas for this week.Summer Tomato RecipesTomato BruschettaAli Slagle15 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easySheet-Pan Baked Feta With Broccolini, Tomatoes and LemonYasmin Fahr25 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyBasil and Tomato Fried RiceHetty Lui McKinnon15 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyDumpling Tomato Salad With Chile Crisp VinaigretteHetty Lui McKinnon20 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easySesame Tomato SaladKay Chun20 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyHot Dogs With Pico de GalloGenevieve Ko, Tanya Sichynsky30 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyJuicy Tomatoes With Parmesan-Olive Bread CrumbsChristian Reynoso40 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyClassic Caprese SaladMelissa Clark15 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyBest GazpachoJulia Moskin20 minutes plus chilling timeSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.Cold Tofu Salad With Tomatoes and PeachesHana Asbrink20 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyMarinated Mozzarella, Olives and Cherry TomatoesDavid Tanis20 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyGrilled Chicken With Tomatoes and CornAli Slagle30 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyTuna and Tomato SaladAli Slagle20 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyPuttanesca Chickpea-Tomato SaladAli Slagle15 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.Kachumbari (Tomato and Onion Relish)Kayla Stewart, Michael W.

Trump and his associates to overturn the 2020 election.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesBy Charlie SavageReporting from WashingtonPublished Aug. 4, 2023Updated Aug. 5, 2023, 9:23 a.m. ETIn accusing former President Donald J. Trump of conspiring to subvert American democracy, the special counsel, Jack Smith, charged the same story three different ways. The charges are novel applications of criminal laws to unprecedented circumstances, heightening legal risks, but Mr. Smith\u2019s tactic gives him multiple paths in obtaining and upholding a guilty verdict.\u201cEspecially in a case like this, you want to have multiple charges that are applicable or provable with the same evidence, so that if on appeal you lose one, you still have the conviction,\u201d said Julie O\u2019Sullivan, a Georgetown University law professor and former federal prosecutor.That structure in the indictment is only one of several strategic choices by Mr. Smith \u2014 including what facts and potential charges he chose to include or omit \u2014 that may foreshadow and shape how an eventual trial of Mr. Trump will play out.The four charges rely on three criminal statutes: a count of conspiring to defraud the government, another of conspiring to disenfranchise voters, and two counts related to corruptly obstructing a congressional proceeding. Applying each to Mr. Trump\u2019s actions raises various complexities, according to a range of criminal law experts.At the same time, the indictment hints at how Mr. Smith is trying to sidestep legal pitfalls and potential defenses. He began with an unusual preamble that reads like an opening statement at trial, acknowledging that Mr. Trump had a right to challenge the election results in court and even to lie about them, but drawing a distinction with the defendant\u2019s pursuit of \u201cunlawful means of discounting legitimate votes and subverting the election results.\u201dWhile the indictment is sprawling in laying out a case against Mr. Trump, it brings a selective lens on the multifaceted efforts by the former president and his associates to overturn the 2020 election.\u201cThe strength of the indictment is that it is very narrowly written,\u201d said Ronald S. Sullivan Jr., a Harvard Law School professor and former public defender. \u201cThe government is not attempting to prove too much, but rather it went for low-hanging fruit.\u201dFor one, Mr. Smith said little about the violent events of Jan. 6, leaving out vast amounts of evidence in the report by a House committee that separately investigated the matter. He focused more on a brazen plan to recruit false slates of electors from swing states and a pressure campaign on Vice President Mike Pence to block the congressional certification of Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s victory.That choice dovetails with Mr. Smith\u2019s decision not to charge Mr. Trump with inciting an insurrection or seditious conspiracy \u2014 potential charges the House committee recommended. By eschewing them, he avoided having the case focus on the inflammatory but occasionally ambiguous remarks Mr. Trump made to his supporters as they morphed into a mob, avoiding tough First Amendment objections that defense lawyers could raise.For another, while Mr. Smith described six of Mr. Trump\u2019s associates as co-conspirators, none were charged. It remains unclear whether some of them will eventually be indicted if they do not cooperate, or whether he intends to target only Mr. Trump so the case will move faster.ImageMr. Smith chose to say very little about the violent events of Jan. 6 and instead focused on the scheme to recruit slates of fake electors and the pressure Mr. Trump brought upon Vice President Pence.Credit...Jason Andrew for The New York TimesAmong the charges Mr. Smith did bring against Mr. Trump, corrupt obstruction of an official proceeding is the most familiar in how it applies to the aftermath of the 2020 election. Already, hundreds of ordinary Jan. 6 rioters have been charged with it.To date, most judges in Jan. 6 cases, at the district court and appeals court level, have upheld the use of the statute. But a few Trump-appointed judges have favored a more narrow interpretation, like limiting the law to situations in which people destroyed evidence or sought a benefit more concrete than having their preferred candidate win an election.Mr. Trump, of course, would have personally benefited from staying in office, making that charge stronger against him than against the rioters. Still, a possible risk is if the Supreme Court soon takes up one of the rioter cases and then narrows the scope of the law in a way that would affect the case against Mr. Trump.Proving IntentSome commentators have argued in recent days that prosecutors must persuade the jury that Mr. Trump knew his voter fraud claims were false to prove corrupt intent. But that is oversimplified, several experts said.To be sure, experts broadly agree that Mr. Smith will have an easier time winning a conviction if jurors are persuaded that Mr. Trump knew he was lying about everything. To that end, the indictment details how he \u201cwas notified repeatedly that his claims were untrue\u201d and \u201cdeliberately disregarded the truth.\u201d\u201cWhat you see in Trump \u2014 a guy who seems to inhabit his own fictional universe \u2014 is something you see in other fraud defendants,\u201d said David Alan Sklansky, a Stanford University law professor. \u201cIt\u2019s a common challenge in a fraud case to prove that at some level the defendant knew what he was telling people wasn\u2019t true. The way you prove it is, in part, by showing that lots of people made clear to the defendant that what he was saying was baseless.\u201dMoreover, the indictment emphasizes several episodes in which Mr. Trump had firsthand knowledge that his statements were false. Prosecutors can use those instances to urge jurors to infer that Mr. Trump knew he was lying about everything else, too.The indictment, for example, recounts a taped call on Jan. 2 with Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, in which Mr. Trump shared a series of conspiracy theories that Mr. Raffensperger systematically debunked in detail. But on Twitter the next day, Mr. Trump \u201cfalsely claimed that the Georgia secretary of state had not addressed\u201d the allegations.And on Jan. 5, Mr. Pence told Mr. Trump that he had no lawful authority to alter or delay the counting of Mr. Biden\u2019s electoral votes, but \u201chours later\u201d Mr. Trump issued a statement through his campaign saying the opposite: \u201cThe vice president and I are in total agreement that the vice president has the power to act.\u201dImageVice President Pence appears during House committee hearings investigating Jan. 6. The indictment suggests Mr. Trump knew he was lying about what Mr. Pence had told him on January 5.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesIn any case, several rioters have already argued that they did not have \u201ccorrupt intent\u201d because they sincerely believed the election had been stolen. That has not worked: Judges have said that corrupt intent can be shown by engaging in other unlawful actions like trespassing, assaulting the police and destroying property.\u201cBelief that your actions are serving a greater good does not negate consciousness of wrongdoing,\u201d Judge Royce C. Lamberth wrote last month.Mr. Trump, of course, did not rampage through the Capitol. But the indictment accuses him of committing other crimes \u2014 the fraud and voter disenfranchisement conspiracies \u2014 based on wrongful conduct. It cites Mr. Trump\u2019s bid to use fake electors in violation of the Electoral Count Act and his solicitation of fraud at the Justice Department and in Georgia, where he pressured Mr. Raffensperger to help him \u201cfind\u201d 11,780 votes, enough to overcome Mr. Biden\u2019s margin of victory.\u201cWhether he thinks he won or lost is relevant but not determinative,\u201d said Paul Rosenzweig, a former prosecutor who worked on the independent counsel investigation into President Bill Clinton. \u201cTrump could try to achieve vindicating his beliefs legally. The conspiracy is tied to the illegal means. So he has to say that he thought \u2018finding\u2019 11,000 votes was legal, or that fake electors were legal. That is much harder to say with a straight face.\u201dProving Mr. Trump\u2019s intent will also be key to the charges of defrauding the government and disenfranchising voters. But it may be easier because those laws do not have the heightened standard of \u201ccorrupt\u201d intent as the obstruction statute does.Court rulings interpreting the statute that criminalizes defrauding the United States, for example, have established that evidence of deception or dishonesty is sufficient. In a 1924 Supreme Court ruling, Chief Justice William H. Taft wrote that it covers interference with a government function \u201cby deceit, craft or trickery, or at least by means that are dishonest.\u201d A 1989 appeals court ruling said the dishonest actions need not be crimes in and of themselves.This factor may help explain the indictment\u2019s emphasis on the fake electors schemes in one state after another, a repetitive narrative that risks dullness: It would be hard to credibly argue that Mr. Trump and his co-conspirators thought the fake slates they submitted were real, and the indictment accuses them of other forms of trickery as well.ImageThe opening of the Michigan Electoral College session at the State Capitol in 2020.

Unlike the other charges, it had not been a major part of the public discussion of the investigation \u2014 for example, it was not among the charges recommended by the House Jan. 6 committee.Congress enacted the law after the Civil War to provide a tool for federal prosecutors to go after Southern white people, including Ku Klux Klan members, who used terrorism to prevent formerly enslaved Black people from voting. But in the 20th century, the Supreme Court upheld a broadened use of the law to address election-fraud conspiracies. The idea is that any conspiracy to engineer dishonest election results victimizes all voters in an election.\u201cIt was a good move to charge that statute, partly because that is really what this case really is about \u2014 depriving the people of the right to choose their president,\u201d said Robert S. Litt, a former federal prosecutor and a top intelligence lawyer in the Obama administration.That statute has mostly been used to address misconduct leading up to and during an election, like bribing voters or stuffing ballot boxes, rather than misconduct after an election. Still, in 1933, an appeals court upheld its use in a case involving people who reported false totals from a voter tabulation machine.It has never been used before in a conspiracy to use fake slates of Electoral College voters from multiple states to keep legitimate electors from being counted and thereby subvert the results of a presidential election \u2014 a situation that itself was unprecedented.Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers have signaled they will argue that he had a First Amendment right to say whatever he wanted. Indeed, the indictment acknowledged that it was not illegal in and of itself for Mr. Trump to lie.But in portraying Mr. Trump\u2019s falsehoods as \u201cintegral to his criminal plans,\u201d Mr. Smith suggested he would frame those public statements as contributing to unlawful actions and as evidence they were undertaken with bad intentions, not as crimes in and of themselves.ImageMr. Trump at Reagan National Airport Thursday following his court appearance. Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team has signaled they will argue that he had a First Amendment right to say whatever he wanted.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesA related defense Mr. Trump may raise is the issue of \u201cadvice of counsel.\u201d If a defendant relied in good faith on a lawyer who incorrectly informed him that doing something would be legal, a jury may decide he lacked criminal intent. But there are limits. Among them, the defendant must have told the lawyer all the relevant facts, and the theory must be \u201creasonable.\u201dThe indictment discusses how even though White House lawyers told Mr. Trump that Mr. Pence had no lawful authority to overturn Mr. Biden\u2019s victory, an outside lawyer \u2014 John Eastman, described in the indictment as Co-Conspirator 2 and who separately faces disbarment proceedings \u2014 advised him that Mr. Pence could.Several legal specialists agreed that Mr. Trump has an advice-of-counsel argument to make. But Samuel W. Buell, a Duke University law professor, said Mr. Smith was likely to try to rebut it by pointing to the repeated instances in which Mr. Trump\u2019s White House legal advisers told him that Mr. Eastman was wrong.\u201cYou have to have a genuine good-faith belief that the legal advice is legitimate and valid, not just \u2018I\u2019m going to keep running through as many lawyers as I can until one tells me something I want to hear, no matter how crazy and implausible it is,\u2019\u201d Mr. Buell said.Charlie Savage is a Washington-based national security and legal policy correspondent.

Trump\u2019s growing cast of lawyers is marked by a web of overlapping interests encompassing witnesses, co-defendants and potential targets.Give this articleBy Alan Feuer,\u00a0Ben Protess and Maggie HabermanAug. 5, 2023Updated 9:37 a.m. ETM. Evan Corcoran, a lawyer who accompanied former President Donald J. Trump to court this week for his arraignment on charges of trying to overturn the 2020 election, has given crucial evidence in Mr. Trump\u2019s other federal case \u2014 the one accusing him of illegally hoarding classified documents.Another lawyer close to Mr. Trump, Boris Epshteyn, sat for an interview with prosecutors this spring and could be one of the former president\u2019s co-conspirators in the election tampering case.And Mr. Epshteyn\u2019s lawyer, Todd Blanche, is defending Mr. Trump against both the documents and election case indictments.The legal team that Mr. Trump has assembled to represent him in the twin prosecutions by the special counsel, Jack Smith, is marked by a tangled web of potential conflicts and overlapping interests \u2014 so much so that Mr. Smith\u2019s office has started asking questions.While it is not uncommon for lawyers in complex matters \u2014 like large mob cases or financial inquiries \u2014 to wear many hats or to play competing roles, the Gordian knot of intertwined imperatives in the Trump investigations is particularly intricate and insular.Some of the lawyers involved in the cases are representing both charged defendants and uncharged witnesses. At least one could eventually become a defendant, and another could end up as a witness in one case and Mr. Trump\u2019s defender in a different one.All of that sits atop another thorny fact: Many of the lawyers are being paid by Save America PAC, Mr. Trump\u2019s political action committee, which has itself been under government scrutiny for months. Some of the witnesses those lawyers represent work for the Trump Organization, Mr. Trump\u2019s company, but their legal defense has not been arranged by the company, but rather by Mr. Trump\u2019s own legal team, a person with knowledge of the matter said.Although clients might choose to stick with their lawyers despite a conflict, just this week, prosecutors under Mr. Smith sent up a warning flare about these issues. They asked Judge Aileen M. Cannon, who is overseeing the documents case, to conduct a hearing \u201cregarding potential conflicts\u201d arising from the complex client list of one lawyer, Stanley Woodward Jr.Mr. Woodward represents Walt Nauta, Mr. Trump\u2019s personal aide and one of his co-defendants in the documents case. Mr. Woodward has also worked for at least three witnesses in the broader inquiry who could be called to testify at trial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStanley Woodward Jr.\nLAWYER\n\n\nIs a lawyer for ...\n\n\nIs also a lawyer for ...\n\n\nWalt Nauta\nCo-defendant\n\n\nThree witnesses\n\n\nDonald J.

Trump\ndefendant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of those witnesses, Yuscil Taveras, an information technology worker at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump\u2019s private club and residence in Florida, recently provided prosecutors with potentially incriminating information about Mr. Nauta after parting ways with Mr. Woodward and getting a new lawyer.In a motion to Judge Cannon filed on Wednesday, prosecutors said that given all of this, Mr. Woodward could have \u201cdivided loyalties\u201d and asked the judge to inform Mr. Woodward\u2019s clients about the \u201cpotential risks\u201d they face.Prosecutors appear to have similar qualms about another lawyer in the documents case, John Irving, who represents Carlos De Oliveira, Mr. Trump\u2019s other co-defendant, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Irving\u2019s client list also includes three witnesses who were interviewed by investigators and could, in theory, end up on the stand.Mr. Woodward has signaled that he will not contest the need to hold a hearing. And he and Mr. Irving, both of whom declined to comment, disclosed the potential conflicts to their clients early on, informing them that there could come a point when they would need new lawyers, according to people familiar with the matter.In a statement, Steven Cheung, a spokesman for Mr. Trump, argued that it would be normal for the judge to hold a hearing to consider the potential conflicts, describing it as \u201ccommonplace\u201d in such a broad case.\u201cThere is nothing unusual or concerning about any court confirming that President Trump and others are aware of any potential waivable conflicts issues, of which they all are certainly already aware,\u201d he said. \u201cAny attempt to read into this or otherwise guess about the president\u2019s legal strategy is ridiculous and sad.\u201dStill, the complexities surrounding the case are extensive and have raised concerns for prosecutors.\u201cThis is boundary breaking,\u201d Bruce Green, who teaches legal ethics at Fordham Law School in New York, said about the totality of the issues involved. \u201cWhat I\u2019m most curious about is why these lawyers want to play so many roles. Usually, lawyers just want to be lawyers.\u201dThe potential conflicts confronting the lawyers in Mr. Trump\u2019s prosecutions come from a variety of sources.Some involve situations in which the lawyers could be put in the untenable position of cross-examining a former client in the service of defending a current one. Others stem from bumping up against the guardrails put in place to keep lawyers from advocating for their clients with one hand while possibly incriminating them with the other.Then there is the issue of the lawyers\u2019 bills largely being paid by Mr. Trump\u2019s political action committee. That situation, said Stephen Gillers, a legal ethics professor at New York University, was theoretically not all that unusual. Organizations often foot the bill for employees who need legal representation resulting from \u201cthe scope of their employment,\u201d he said.Still, Mr. Gillers said, problems can arise when the entity paying the fees chooses or steers a lawyer toward a client and that lawyer has competing loyalties when it comes to the payer and the client\u2019s best interests.Many potential objections to conflicts in these cases could be waived by the clients or otherwise mitigated by the courts, Mr. Green said. But he cautioned that judges often lean toward avoiding conflicts at all costs \u2014 up to and including disqualifying lawyers who face them \u2014 because the consequences of allowing them to continue could result in the dismissal of the case.One of the most awkward situations in a Trump-related case came on Thursday when the former president was accompanied to his arraignment on election interference charges by Mr. Corcoran, a lawyer who had worked with him before on both that matter and the documents case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM.

Trump\nDEFENDANT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr. Corcoran\u2019s presence in the courtroom was somewhat unexpected because five months ago a federal judge had ordered him to provide Mr. Smith with the extensive audio notes he made about his work for Mr. Trump. The recorded notes were handed over after the judge determined that Mr. Trump had likely misled Mr. Corcoran and tried to use his legal services to commit a crime \u2014 an exception to the attorney-client privilege that would normally protect such recordings.The audio notes, in which Mr. Corcoran described assisting Mr. Trump to comply with a subpoena that demanded all of the classified materials in his possession, played a central role in the indictment that was filed in June accusing Mr. Trump of illegally retaining more than 30 sensitive documents after leaving office.The notes laid out in detail how Mr. Trump pressured Mr. Corcoran to prevent investigators from reclaiming classified material, according to the indictment, suggesting that he \u201chide or destroy documents called for by the grand jury subpoena.\u201dProsecutors are likely to call Mr. Corcoran as a witness at Mr. Trump\u2019s documents trial in Florida, even as he might continue to assist the former president\u2019s defense team on the election case in Washington, people with knowledge of the matter have said. Mr. Smith\u2019s prosecutors have inquired about Mr. Corcoran\u2019s role in the election case, but have not yet signaled that they plan to object to it.Although he was in court on Thursday, Mr. Corcoran has not formally appeared on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf in the case. And if there were a conflict, Mr. Trump could choose to waive potential objections to it. It is unclear why Mr. Trump, who prizes loyalty, would continue to want Mr. Corcoran\u2019s assistance.But it could be part of a long-shot challenge to the so-called crime-fraud exception that permitted the notes to be handed over in the documents case.\u201cThere is a rule called the advocate-witness rule that forbids lawyers from occupying both roles, and Trump may believe it will be easier to keep Corcoran off the stand and to exclude his grand jury testimony if he remains on the trial team,\u201d Mr. Gillers said.A different twist emerged on Tuesday when the election case indictment was handed up in Washington. The charges mentioned six co-conspirators who helped Mr. Trump to execute his plans. One of them \u2014 Co-Conspirator 6 \u2014 was described as a \u201cpolitical consultant\u201d who assisted Mr. Trump in what has become known as the \u201cfake electors\u201d scheme.While prosecutors have not identified Co-Conspirator 6, an email obtained by The New York Times suggests that it could be Mr. Epshteyn, a lawyer and strategic adviser to Mr. Trump who was paid for political consulting in 2020 and who has served throughout the recent investigations as one of his top advisers and his in-house counsel. The email\u2019s contents and its recipient \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s former lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who is Co-Conspirator 1 in the indictment \u2014 match that of an email described in the indictment as sent by Co-conspirator 6.It would be an uncomfortable development, to say the least, if Mr. Epshteyn, who often travels with the former president and accompanied him to his arraignment on Thursday, was also an unnamed, unindicted participant in the case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTodd Blanche\nLAWYER\n\n\nBoris Epshteyn\nLAWYER\n\n\nIs a lawyer for...\n\n\nIs in-house\ncounsel for ...\n\n\nWas a possible\nco-conspirator in the\nJan. 6 case with ...\n\n\nIs a lawyer in the Jan. 6\nand classified documents\ncases for ...\n\n\nDonald J.

Reporters asked about pardons. Mike Pence was heckled. Republicans found it\u2019s not easy to escape the fallout from Donald J. Trump\u2019s legal peril.Give this articleGov. Ron DeSantis of Florida and his family at a dairy store on Friday in Waukon, Iowa. Mr. DeSantis pitched his economic plans in the state, but could not entirely escape the drumbeat of news from Washington.Credit...Rachel Mummey for The New York TimesBy Lisa Lerer and Nicholas NehamasNicholas Nehamas reported from Decorah, Iowa.Aug. 5, 2023, 5:00 a.m. ETDays after the front-runner was indicted on charges of trying to subvert an election, Republican candidates in their presidential primary returned to the campaign trail acting as if nothing had changed.Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida scooped ice cream in Iowa as he pitched his economic plans. Senator Tim Scott met community leaders at the southern border with a promise to get tough on immigration. Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor, showed up in Ukraine, a dramatic attempt to focus on foreign policy. And former Vice President Mike Pence talked up the \u201cTrump-Pence administration\u201d record at a town hall in New Hampshire.But their dogged attempts to create a political safe space \u2014 an indictment-free zone, where they are not asked to defend or attack former President Donald J. Trump, the dominant leader in the race and the party\u2019s most powerful figure \u2014 kept failing.Reporters asked questions about stolen-election lies and presidential pardons. Voters wanted to know what they thought of the new charges. Trump supporters greeted Mr. Pence with a sign calling him a \u201ctraitor.\u201d Mr. Trump, too, had thoughts.\u201cEvery time they file an indictment, we go way up in the polls,\u201d he said at a Republican Party dinner in Montgomery, Ala., on Friday night. \u201cWe need one more indictment to close out this election.\u201dThe scenes demonstrated the nearly impossible challenge before the Republican field as the candidates soldier on in a primary like no other. As Mr. Trump rallies Republicans to his side against what he says is a political persecution, how can they move beyond a past election to talk about the future?For months, their strategy has been simple: Ignore, deflect and change the subject. But it\u2019s an approach that became significantly harder this week, as the felony counts against Mr. Trump grew to number 78 across three criminal cases with the addition of a federal indictment in a Washington, D.C., federal court accusing him of conspiring to defraud the government and to obstruct an official proceeding, as well as other crimes.Addressing voters at a brewery in northeast Iowa on Friday morning, Mr. DeSantis focused on his usual themes: his record as Florida governor, his biography as a father and a military veteran, and his plans on immigration and economic policy. But he could not entirely escape the drumbeat of news from Washington.When a member of the audience asked whether he thought Mr. Trump\u2019s latest indictment was a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d Mr. DeSantis responded that the case was \u201cpolitically motivated, absolutely,\u201d and pledged to end the \u201cweaponization\u201d of federal government.ImageMr. DeSantis tried to steer the conversation away from former President Donald J. Trump while at a brewery in Decorah, Iowa.Credit...Rachel Mummey for The New York TimesLater, a reporter asked whether he would pardon Mr. Trump, should the former president be convicted in the election case. Mr. DeSantis suggested he would \u2014 before quickly trying to recast the race as about the future.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s in the best interest of the country to have a former president that\u2019s almost 80 years old go to prison,\u201d the governor, 44, told reporters at a tire shop in Waverly, Iowa. \u201cAnd just like Ford pardoned Nixon, sometimes you\u2019ve got to put this stuff behind you, and we need to start focusing on things having to do with the country\u2019s future.\u201dHe added: \u201cThis election needs to be about Jan. 20, 2025, not Jan. 6, 2021.\u201dStill, there were some signs that the newest charges had pushed Mr. DeSantis, whose campaign is under pressure to appeal to more moderate voters, to inch toward criticism of Mr. Trump. After his event, he acknowledged that claims about the 2020 election\u2019s having been stolen were \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d \u2014 a more direct response than he typically gives when asked about Mr. Trump\u2019s defeat.\u201cAll those theories that were put out did not prove to be true,\u201d Mr. DeSantis said in response to a reporter\u2019s question.Part of the challenge for Mr. Trump\u2019s opponents is that even Republicans who want to move past the former president defend him. Sandy Lloyd, a 61-year-old fourth-grade teacher, said she did not plan to vote for Mr. Trump, having grown tired of the frequent controversies surrounding him. Yet she said that she thought the election had been stolen and that she didn\u2019t want to see Mr. DeSantis attack Mr. Trump.\u201cIf I\u2019m going for a new job, I don\u2019t go into my interview and attack everybody else \u2014 I tell them why they want me,\u201d Ms. Lloyd said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I want to hear. Why do I want you as president?\u201dOthers took a different view, arguing that the criminal charges against Mr. Trump would weaken him in a general election.James Smith, a supporter of Mr. DeSantis who drove from Wisconsin to see the governor, said he wanted the Florida governor to be aggressive.\u201cI would love for him to go harder against Trump,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to win the Republican nomination by not going after the leader. The only way to shake up the race is by attacking.\u201dImageSupporters of Mr. Trump outside a town hall event featuring former Vice President Mike Pence in Londonderry, N.H.Credit...Joe Buglewicz for The New York TimesBut no candidate has a harder time escaping the political realities of the Trump indictments than Mr. Pence, who told prosecutors that Mr. Trump had pressured him to reject electoral votes in an attempt to disrupt the transfer of power.About a dozen Trump supporters gathered outside the American Legion post where Mr. Pence spoke Friday evening. They heckled him as he entered.\u201cWhat Pence did is, he committed treason \u2014 that\u2019s the bottom line,\u201d said Derek Arnold, a protester from Derry, N.H. \u201cHe had the choice to do the right thing. And that man knows right from wrong, and we\u2019re here to let him know that he did us wrong.\u201dWhen Mr. Pence told a standing crowd of around 100 people that he had \u201cstood loyally by President Trump,\u201d his comment prompted scoffing from some in the room. But he was applauded after he finished his thought: \u201cAnd I never changed my commitment to him until the day came that my oath to the Constitution required me to do otherwise.\u201dImageMr. Pence answering questions during a campaign town hall event Friday night in Londonderry, N.H.Credit...Joe Buglewicz for The New York TimesAsked if he would pardon Mr. Trump, Mr. Pence was noncommittal.\u201cI really don\u2019t understand why some candidates in the Republican primary are assuming that the president is going to be found guilty in these various cases,\u201d Mr. Pence said. \u201cLet him make his case in court, and if I have the privilege of being president of the United States, whatever pardon request comes before me, I\u2019ll always give a thoughtful, prayerful consideration.\u201dAround a dozen people in the crowd said they were still making up their minds on whom to support. Some were looking for a Trump alternative, but not all considered the charges against him disqualifying.\u201cI feel bad that the country has to go through that, never mind Trump himself,\u201d Fran York said of the prosecutions of Mr. Trump. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that what he did was so bad that he should be indicted.\u201dMr. York, who is supporting Mr. Pence, said he would vote for Mr. Trump again if he won the nomination.Mr. Scott, who has said little about the election indictment, went to Yuma, Ariz., to promote his plan to spend $10 billion on the border wall started by Mr. Trump. There, too, he repeated his accusation that the Justice Department was \u201chunting Republicans.\u201d\u201cMy perspective is that the D.O.J. continues to weaponize their power against political opponents,\u201d he said, deflecting a question from an NBC reporter about whether Mr. Trump\u2019s legal cases were dominating the campaign.Perhaps the only candidate other than Mr. Trump who was eager to talk about the indictment was Mr. Christie, who has focused his campaign on undercutting the former president. Mr. Christie has struggled to break 3 percent in recent polling of the contest.\u201cIt\u2019s an aggressive indictment,\u201d he said from a train headed to Kyiv, Ukraine, on Thursday night. \u201cBut what I believe is a much more important question than the criminality, in the context of this campaign season, is the fact that he\u2019s morally responsible for Jan. 6.\u201dCharles Homans contributed from Kyiv, Ukraine; Maya King from Montgomery, Ala.; Anjali Huynh from Londonderry, N.H.; and Neil Vigdor from Columbia, S.C.Lisa Lerer is a national political correspondent, covering campaigns, elections and political power.

Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania last week. Mr. Trump has a history of lashing out on social media at the prosecutors bringing criminal charges against him.Credit...Maddie McGarvey for The New York TimesBy Alan Feuer and Maggie HabermanAug. 5, 2023Updated 10:52 a.m. ETThe federal prosecutors overseeing the indictment of former President Donald J. Trump on charges of seeking to overturn the 2020 election asked a judge on Friday night to impose a protective order over the discovery evidence in the case, citing a threatening message that Mr. Trump had posted on social media.By mentioning the incendiary post in an otherwise routine request seeking to keep Mr. Trump from making evidence public, the prosecutors in the office of the special counsel, Jack Smith, were drawing the attention of the judge, Tanya S. Chutkan, to Mr. Trump\u2019s longstanding habit of attacking those involved in criminal cases against him.Hours later, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign responded with a statement calling the post \u201cthe definition of political speech.\u201d The statement suggested that the post had not been directed at anyone involved in the election interference case, saying it was meant for Mr. Trump\u2019s political adversaries.The exchange of words began on Friday evening when Mr. Trump posted a message on Truth Social, his social media platform, issuing a vague but strongly worded threat.\u201cIF YOU GO AFTER ME, I\u2019M COMING AFTER YOU!\u201d he wrote.Shortly after, in a standard move early in a criminal prosecution, the government filed its request for a protective order in the case to Judge Chutkan. Prosecutors noted that protections over discovery were \u201cparticularly important\u201d in this instance because Mr. Trump \u201chas previously issued public statements on social media regarding witnesses, judges, attorneys and others associated with legal matters pending against him.\u201dTo prove their point, they included a screenshot of the former president\u2019s threatening post from that same evening.A short time after the government\u2019s filing, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign issued a statement with no aide\u2019s name attached, insisting he was practicing his First Amendment rights.\u201cThe Truth post cited is the definition of political speech,\u201d the statement said, adding that it was in response to \u201cdishonest special interest groups\u201d and political committees attacking him.That Mr. Trump is a political candidate exercising free speech is going to be an element of his defense in the latest case against him. Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign on Friday also posted on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, a 60-second ad describing the prosecutors who have considered cases against him as the \u201cfraud squad\u201d acting on behalf of President Biden. (It includes the New York attorney general, Letitia James, who has brought a civil action case.)The ad is one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most aggressive denigrations of the prosecutors, whom he has consistently denounced. He has also promised that if elected, he would appoint a \u201creal\u201d special prosecutor to investigate Mr. Biden and his family, proposing to eliminate the post-Watergate norm of Justice Department independence.But the Truth Social post was more direct than his past comments, in a case where a key aspect of the indictment describes how Mr. Trump\u2019s repeated and false public claims that he was a victim of widespread election fraud led to the violent attack by a pro-Trump mob at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.Judge Chutkan, who was randomly assigned the case when the indictment was filed on Tuesday, has not yet responded to the government\u2019s request. But other judges in cases involving Mr. Trump have warned him about using threatening language.At a court hearing in Manhattan in April, Justice Juan M. Merchan, who is overseeing Mr. Trump\u2019s state prosecution on charges stemming from a hush payment to a porn actress, warned the former president to refrain from making comments that were \u201clikely to incite violence or civil unrest.\u201dJustice Merchan\u2019s admonition came after Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social saying that \u201cdeath and destruction\u201d could follow if he were charged in the case in Manhattan.That same month, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, who was presiding over a federal rape and defamation lawsuit filed by the writer E. Jean Carroll against Mr. Trump, criticized the former president for posting messages about the case. The ones he had already written were \u201centirely inappropriate,\u201d the judge said.Mr. Trump had derided the case on social media as a \u201cscam\u201d and personally mocked Ms. Carroll.The former president has often ignored such warnings and continued to post threatening or spiteful messages with impunity.After the hearing in front of Justice Merchan, Mr. Trump returned to Florida and to his customary practice, calling the district attorney who brought the New York charges against him, Alvin L. Bragg, a \u201ccriminal,\u201d and Justice Merchan \u201ca Trump-hating judge with a Trump-hating wife and family.\u201dDays after Judge Kaplan\u2019s admonition, Mr. Trump attacked him, too, saying on a trip to one of his golf courses in Ireland that the judge was \u201cextremely hostile.\u201dAlan Feuer covers extremism and political violence.

Vasyl Malyuk, the head of the Security Service of Ukraine, said the country was responsible for recent attacks on Russian vessels, calling them a \u201clogical\u201d and \u201ceffective\u201d tactic \u2014 without explicitly mentioning Saturday\u2019s strike.The tanker was near the Kerch Strait Bridge, a vital connection for Russia to the Crimean Peninsula, which has been under Russian occupation since 2014. Mr. Malyuk suggested that Ukraine would continue attacking the bridge until Russian forces completely withdrew from Ukrainian lands.Russia accused Ukraine of attacking the bridge itself last month, also with sea drones.The attack on Saturday was an apparent continuation of Ukraine\u2019s challenge to Moscow\u2019s control of the Black Sea. A day earlier, the country\u2019s forces had demonstrated the expanding reach of their uncrewed vessels by hitting a Russian naval ship near the Russian port of Novorossiysk, more than 400 miles by sea from the nearest Ukrainian-held shores.ImageA satellite image released by Planet Labs showed a damaged Russian warship near the port of Novorossiysk, Russia, on Friday.Credit...Planet Labs PBC, via Associated PressThe Russian agency said the vessel damaged on Saturday was the oil and chemical tanker Sig, and that it had been approaching the Kerch Strait Bridge from the south with a crew of 11. Rybar, a popular Russian pro-war blog, said the tanker was returning from delivering oil to Syria.In the attack the previous day near Novorossiysk, a Russian shipping and naval hub on the northeastern shore of the Black Sea, a naval drone appeared to slam into a Ropucha-class landing ship that was later seen listing to its port side in photos and videos verified by The New York Times.Three Ukrainian officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military matters, said the attack in Novorossiysk had been carried out by the Security Service of Ukraine and the Ukrainian Navy.A correction was made on\u00a0Aug. 5, 2023:\u00a0An earlier version of this article misstated how many Russian ports were labeled at \u201cwar risk\u201d in a warning from Ukraine\u2019s maritime authority and the date from which that risk began. It referred to six Russian ports on the Black Sea, not all of them, and was starting on Aug. 4, not Aug. 23.How we handle correctionsVictoria Kim is a correspondent based in Seoul, focused on international breaking news coverage.

In addition to the United States and European countries, notable attendees included China, India, Brazil, South Africa and some of the oil-rich Gulf nations that have tried to maintain good relations with both Ukraine and Russia throughout the war, which began in February 2022.Many of the countries that have declared their neutrality appear unlikely to shift their stances, though, and some reject the very concept of choosing sides, framing the war as a contest between superpowers that they want no part in.\u201cThis is not only a conflict between Russia and Ukraine,\u201d Celso Amorim, international affairs adviser to President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva of Brazil, said in a speech that he delivered virtually during the talks. \u201cThis is also a chapter in the longstanding rivalry between Russia and the West,\u201d he said, according to a copy of the speech obtained by The New York Times.The gathering was closed to media, which a Saudi state television correspondent broadcasting from outside the venue attributed to the talks\u2019 \u201csensitivity.\u201d It underscored the tightrope that Saudi Arabia and many other countries are trying to walk to avoid alienating Moscow \u2014 and the challenges that Ukraine will face as it tries to win them over.The meeting is the starting point of what is expected to be a major Ukrainian diplomatic push in the coming months to try to undercut Russia. That began on Wednesday, when President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine recalled his ambassadors for an emergency strategy session on how to get the country\u2019s message out to the world.He told the ambassadors they must use every tool at their disposal \u2014 \u201cofficial and unofficial, institutional and media, cultural diplomacy and the power of ordinary human sincerity\u201d \u2014 to convince both steadfast allies and nations that have largely stayed neutral that the only road to a lasting peace is complete Russian defeat.ImageA Ukrainian artillery unit preparing to fire toward a target last month in Bakhmut, Ukraine.Credit...Finbarr O\u2019Reilly for The New York TimesThe annual United Nations General Assembly session in September will offer another opportunity for Ukraine to make its case. And the country is also planning a summit later in the fall to shore up backing for its 10-point peace formula in the hopes that it will form the backbone of any future settlement.Ukrainian and Western officials tried to temper expectations for the talks this weekend, stressing that they are not likely to bring the war any closer to an end; Russia is not participating.For Ukraine, the gathering comes at a pivotal moment.As furious battles raged across the front lines of Europe\u2019s bloodiest war in decades, Mr. Zelensky told his diplomats on Wednesday that things would grow even more difficult as pressure was likely to build in the coming months to find a negotiated path to peace.The choice of Saudi Arabia as host was no accident, senior Ukrainian officials said, noting the efforts that Kyiv has made to court the kingdom, the world\u2019s largest oil exporter. Like many countries in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia has toed a careful line in the war, giving financial aid to Ukraine even while cultivating close ties to Russia.Last year, the kingdom irritated the White House with a decision to cut oil production in coordination with OPEC Plus \u2014 an energy exporters\u2019 group in which Russia is a key member. The production cut helped stave off a decline in oil prices at a time when the United States was trying to undercut Russian oil revenue.ImagePrince Faisal bin Farhan, left, Saudi Arabia\u2019s foreign minister, with his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, right, and Andriy Yermak, the head of the office of the president of Ukraine, in February in Kyiv, Ukraine\u2019s capital.Credit...Pool photo by Genya SavilovChina has also declared its neutrality, despite providing Russia with vital support that has helped cushion the effects of economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation. Yet after shunning a similar gathering in June in Copenhagen, China attended the Saudi meeting, which may reflect its deepening ties with the host country. Alicja Bachulska, a fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations who studies Chinese foreign policy, said that China\u2019s participation does not mean it is changing its position on the war. But it could help burnish a carefully cultivated effort to look like a responsible and neutral actor, she said.\u201cSimply put,\u201d Ms. Bachulska said, \u201cit seems like a win-win scenario for Beijing.\u201dIndia, which sent its powerful national security adviser, Ajit Doval, to the talks, often cites its long history of nonalignment to explain its neutral position in the war today.But like many of the nations attending, India has also benefited from that stance. By maintaining its trade links with Russia, some of its biggest companies have profited handsomely from the purchase, refining and resale of Russian oil, reducing pressure on the rupee.\u201cWe have accepted the refrain that Ukraine\u2019s narrative has won over Russia, but that is mainly true in the liberal free world,\u201d said Anna Borshchevskaya, a scholar at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy who focuses on Russia in the Middle East. \u201cOutside it, the Russian narrative resonates.\u201dFor Saudi Arabia, which has long served as a mediator in regional conflicts, the gathering in Jeddah is notable because the kingdom is involving itself prominently in a crisis of the highest global priority.The de facto Saudi ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, invited Mr. Zelensky to speak in May in Jeddah at a gathering of Arab states, where the Ukrainian leader urged Middle Eastern rulers to stand with his country against Russia.For Prince Mohammed, 38, the talks offered another chance to try to position himself as a world leader with influence far beyond his region and as a mediator who can bring powerful nations to the table, even as he struggles to end his own country\u2019s involvement in a devastating war in Yemen.\u201cHosting the Ukraine peace talks gives us a taste of Saudi Arabia\u2019s reinvigorated self,\u201d said Bader Al-Saif, an assistant professor of history at Kuwait University.ImageA residential building that was hit by shelling in June in Kryvyi Rih, Ukraine. Credit...Mauricio Lima for The New York TimesUkraine faces a dual challenge as it embarks on its diplomatic push.It needs to keep the support of Western allies firm as it engages in a grueling, bloody and costly counteroffensive that, over the past two months, has yielded some gains but has yet to achieve a major breakthrough. But it also needs to broaden that support by pulling in other countries that have remained noncommittal.That will not be easy, partly because Ukraine and its Western backers are engaged in an intense struggle with Russia to win them over.President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia recently hosted a group of African leaders in his country, offering to provide free grain supplies for a half-dozen African nations. Russia has blockaded Ukrainian grain \u2014 which accounted for 10 percent of the global supply before the war \u2014 and critics have accused Moscow of using hunger as both a weapon and means to bankroll the war.Saudi Arabia must tread carefully as it wades into Ukrainian diplomacy, analysts said. While Russia and Saudi Arabia have long acted in accord on key oil-related issues in ways that were mutually beneficial, there are signs that their longstanding relationship might be under strain, as Russia appears to have pumped more oil recently than it had pledged to.ImagePatrons and staff at a Russian restaurant and nightclub in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

A priest stopped to wipe away her tears. \u201cThe pope \u2014 I don\u2019t think so.\u201dSince declining to name Russia as the aggressor early in the war, Pope Francis has repeatedly expressed solidarity with the Ukrainian people, even calling them \u201cmartyred.\u201d But his methods of pursuing peace \u2014 including a secret mission that baffled Ukrainian officials, and a reluctance to more fulsomely condemn Russia and President Vladimir V. Putin \u2014 have bothered many of the Ukrainian Catholics who came to this week\u2019s major meeting of Catholic youth from around the world.Image\u201cSo many people are showing us support,\u201d said Anastasiia Koval, center.Credit...Jason Horowitz/The New York TimesBefore his arrival on Saturday in F\u00e1tima, in central Portugal, the Vatican said that Francis would pray there for peace in Ukraine and the world while bringing Russia\u2019s invasion back into view. But after praying silently in front of the town\u2019s shrine and a statue of the Virgin Mary, he made no mention of a prayer for peace or Ukraine, and instead reiterated his central World Youth Day message that there is room for everyone in the church.The pope said \u201cnothing,\u201d said the Rev. Roman Demush, who leads the youth ministry office for the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. \u201cThe war should make us scream, and it silences.\u201dF\u00e1tima itself has links to Russia that go back more than a century. The town is best-known in Catholic tradition for three secret, apocalyptic prophesies said to be delivered to three children by an apparition of the Virgin Mary in 1917, when it was a poor village. One of the children went on to become a nun, and said that one prophecy had been that peace would reign on Earth if the pope and the world\u2019s bishops converted Russia, which became Communist in the year of the apparitions, and consecrated the nation to the \u201cImmaculate Heart of Mary.\u201dThe prophecy has drawn renewed attention since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, and the roughly 500 young Ukrainians who made the trip to World Youth Day in Lisbon this week started their pilgrimage in F\u00e1tima. Fifteen of them also met with Francis at the Vatican embassy in Lisbon.ImagePilgrims waiting for the pope\u2019s arrival in F\u00e1tima on Saturday.Credit...Marco Bertorello/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty ImagesBut for those hoping that he might take up their cause at World Youth Day, there was disappointment, just as there was last year when Francis delivered a prayer for peace that consecrated both Russia and Ukraine to Mary, leaving many Ukrainians feeling lumped in with their aggressors.\u201cHe said he was impotent in front of this evil,\u201d Father Demush said after the meeting, adding that the pope had expressed frustration at being unable to stop the violence. Mostly, he said, the pope listened intensely as the young Ukrainian pilgrims spoke about their suffering in the war and the friends and family they had lost.One of the young people, Valentyna Velychko, 17, from Melitopol, said she had spoken of her life under occupation and the experience of having missiles fall on her town, how three of her friends had been killed, and how her boyfriend had lost limbs after stepping on a land mine.Dmytro Bohak, 19, said he had told the pope about injuries he suffered while driving ambulances and other vehicles into Ukraine. He also recalled how another girl had brought tears to the pope\u2019s eyes when she told him that she could no longer recognize her own father, who was disfigured physically and spiritually by the war.But Mr. Bohak said that what was really needed was action by Francis.\u201cIt\u2019s not enough just to listen \u2014 he has to do something,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want the pope to be clear, in an understandable way, that Russia is a terrorist state.\u201dImage\u201cThe war should make us scream, and it silences,\u201d said the Rev. Roman Demush, who leads the youth ministry office for the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church.Credit...Jason Horowitz/The New York TimesOn Friday afternoon, the larger Ukrainian group set up on the curve of a central Lisbon thoroughfare leading to the park where the pope solemnly commemorated the Way of the Cross. They sang their anthem between the Christian rock songs that boomed from the loudspeakers, and dispatched the members who spoke English to talk to the young people marching by.\u201cRussia kills us everyday,\u201d Vira Ivanchuk, 24, told some Spanish girls who had stopped to look at the rows of Ukrainians. \u201cThe faces on the shirts are a small percentage of the children they are killing.\u201dWhen they left, Ms. Ivanchuk explained why she had felt it necessary to make her case.\u201cI understand that this is maybe not the place, a festival, where people want to talk about this,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we need more weapons.

Some traded traditional Ukrainian dolls with Americans who gave out red, white and blue rubber bracelets.Olena Syniuhu, 19, from Lviv, who handed out the dolls, said she had been nervous that some of the young people \u2014 especially Americans, who she said had \u201cgiven such a huge support to us\u201d \u2014 would be exasperated with them. Instead, she said, she found herself next to a group of teenagers from Miami on Thursday night who made it abundantly clear \u201cthey were with us.

It\u2019s also a luxury motor coach that was funded by someone else\u2019s money.Justice Clarence Thomas, circa 2000, with his great-nephew and his Prevost Le Mirage XL Marathon motor coach.Credit...Supported bySKIP ADVERTISEMENTGive this articleBy Jo Becker and Julie TateAug. 5, 2023Justice Clarence Thomas met the recreational vehicle of his dreams in Phoenix, on a November Friday in 1999.With some time to kill before an event that night, he headed to a dealership just west of the airport. There sat a used Prevost Le Mirage XL Marathon, eight years old and 40 feet long, with orange flames licking down the sides. In the words of one of his biographers, \u201che kicked the tires and climbed aboard,\u201d then quickly negotiated a handshake deal. A few weeks later, Justice Thomas drove his new motor coach off the lot and into his everyman, up-by-the-bootstraps self-mythology.There he is behind the wheel during a rare 2007 interview with \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d talking about how the steel-clad converted bus allows him to escape the \u201cmeanness that you see in Washington.\u201d He regularly slips into his speeches his love of driving it through the American heartland \u2014 \u201cthe part we fly over.\u201d And in a documentary financed by conservative admirers, Justice Thomas, who was born into poverty in Georgia, waxes rhapsodic about the familiarity of spending time with the regular folks he meets along the way in R.V. parks and Walmart parking lots.\u201cI don\u2019t have any problem with going to Europe, but I prefer the United States, and I prefer seeing the regular parts of the United States,\u201d he told the filmmakers, adding: \u201cThere\u2019s something normal to me about it. I come from regular stock, and I prefer being around that.\u201dBut there is an untold, and far more complex, back story to Justice Thomas\u2019s R.V. \u2014 one that not only undercuts the mythology but also leaves unanswered a host of questions about whether the justice received, and failed to disclose, a lavish gift from a wealthy friend.His Prevost Marathon cost $267,230, according to title history records obtained by The New York Times. And Justice Thomas, who in the ensuing years would tell friends how he had scrimped and saved to afford the motor coach, did not buy it on his own. In fact, the purchase was underwritten, at least in part, by Anthony Welters, a close friend who made his fortune in the health care industry.He provided Justice Thomas with financing that experts said a bank would have been unlikely to extend \u2014 not only because Justice Thomas was already carrying a lot of debt, but because the Marathon brand\u2019s high level of customization makes its used motor coaches difficult to value.In an email to The Times, Mr. Welters wrote: \u201cHere is what I can share. Twenty-five years ago, I loaned a friend money, as I have other friends and family. We\u2019ve all been on one side or the other of that equation. He used it to buy a recreational vehicle, which is a passion of his.\u201d Roughly nine years later, \u201cthe loan was satisfied,\u201d Mr. Welters added. He subsequently sent The Times a photograph of the original title bearing his signature and a handwritten \u201clien release\u201d date of Nov. 22, 2008.But despite repeated requests over nearly two weeks, Mr. Welters did not answer further questions essential to understanding his arrangement with Justice Thomas.He would not say how much he had lent Justice Thomas, how much the justice had repaid and whether any of the debt had been forgiven or otherwise discharged. He declined to provide The Times with a copy of a loan agreement \u2014 or even say if one existed. Nor would he share the basic terms of the loan, such as what, if any, interest rate had been charged or whether Justice Thomas had adhered to an agreed-upon repayment schedule. And when asked to elaborate on what he had meant when he said the loan had been \u201csatisfied,\u201d he did not respond.\u201c\u2018Satisfied\u2019 doesn\u2019t necessarily mean someone paid the loan back,\u201d said Michael Hamersley, a tax lawyer and expert who has testified before Congress. \u201c\u2018Satisfied\u2019 could also mean the lender formally forgave the debt, or otherwise just stopped pursuing repayment.\u201dJustice Thomas, for his part, did not respond to detailed questions about the loan, sent to him through the Supreme Court\u2019s spokeswoman.The two men\u2019s silence serves to obscure whether Justice Thomas had an obligation to report the arrangement under a federal ethics law that requires justices to disclose certain gifts, liabilities and other financial dealings that could pose conflicts of interest.Vehicle loans are generally exempt from those reporting requirements, as long as they are secured by the vehicle and the loan amount doesn\u2019t exceed its purchase price. But private loans like the one between Mr. Welters and Justice Thomas can be deemed gifts or income to the borrower under the federal tax code if they don\u2019t hew to certain criteria: Essentially, experts said, the loan must have well-documented, commercially reasonable terms along the lines of what a bank would offer, and the borrower must adhere to those terms and pay back the principal and interest in full.Richard W. Painter, a White House ethics lawyer during the George W. Bush administration, said that when it comes to questions of disclosure, the ethics treatment of gifts and income often parallels the tax treatment. But those intricacies aside, he said, \u201cjustices just should not be accepting private loans from wealthy individuals outside their family.\u201d If they do, he added, \u201cyou have to ask, why is a justice going to this private individual and not to a commercial lender, unless the justice is getting something he or she otherwise could not get.\u201dThe Times\u2019s unearthing of the loan arrangement is the latest in a series of revelations showing how wealthy benefactors have bestowed an array of benefits on Justice Thomas and his wife, Virginia Thomas: helping to pay for his great-nephew\u2019s tuition, steering business to Mrs. Thomas\u2019s consulting firm, buying and renovating the house where his mother lives and inviting the Thomases on trips both domestic and foreign that included travel aboard private jets and a yacht.Justice Thomas has pointed to interpretations of the disclosure rules to defend his failure to report much of the largess he has received. He has said he was advised that the trips fell under an exemption for gifts involving \u201cpersonal hospitality\u201d from close friends, for instance, and a lawyer close to the Thomases contended in a statement that the justice did not need to disclose the tuition because it was a gift to his great-nephew, over whom he had legal custody, rather than to him.The Thomases\u2019 known benefactors include wealthy men like the Dallas real estate developer Harlan Crow, the conservative judicial kingmaker Leonard Leo and several members of the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans, which honors people who succeed despite adversity. Among them: the longtime Miami Dolphins owner Wayne Huizenga, who flew the justice around on his jet.Mr. Welters, while also a Horatio Alger member, stands apart. For one thing, the two men\u2019s friendship predates Justice Thomas\u2019s time on the federal bench. They met around 1980, when both were members of a small, informal club of Black congressional aides to Republican lawmakers \u2014 Mr. Welters worked for Senator Jacob K. Javits of New York and Justice Thomas for Senator John C. Danforth of Missouri.ImageAnthony Welters, shown with his wife Beatrice in 2016, was a close friend of Justice Thomas\u2019s from their time working as congressional aides.Credit...Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images for NYU Langone Medical Center\u201cIt wasn\u2019t exactly fashionable to be a Black person working for a Republican, and it was comforting to meet others in the same boat,\u201d the justice wrote in his autobiography, \u201cMy Grandfather\u2019s Son.\u201dThey had much in common. Like Justice Thomas, Mr. Welters was raised in poverty, sharing a cramped tenement in Harlem with his parents and three brothers and, after his mother\u2019s death when he was 8, shining shoes under an elevated subway to help make ends meet.As both men climbed the ladder as political appointees in the Reagan administration, their friendship grew. They stayed close after Justice Thomas joined the federal appeals court in Washington in 1990 and Mr. Welters left government to found AmeriChoice, a Medicaid services provider that he sold to UnitedHealthcare for $530 million in stock in 2002 and continued to lead until retiring in 2016. Mr. Welters and his wife, Beatrice, named Justice Thomas the godfather of one of their two boys, according to The Village Voice.When Justice Thomas\u2019s 1991 Supreme Court nomination ran into trouble after a former subordinate, Anita Hill, accused him of sexual harassment, Mr. Welters stood by his friend, providing behind-the-scenes advice, according to a book on the hearings written by Mr. Danforth.And in 1998, the year before the motor coach purchase, Justice Thomas returned the favor. That is when Mr. Welters and his wife, through their foundation, started the AnBryce scholarship program, which gives underprivileged students a full ride to New York University\u2019s law school, along with networking opportunities and career support. Justice Thomas lent his considerable imprimatur to the program, interviewing applicants in his Supreme Court chambers, mentoring scholars and later hiring one graduate as a clerk.By that point, the justice had become fixated on owning an R.V., and not just any R.V., but the Rolls-Royce of motor coaches: a custom Prevost Marathon, or as he once put it, a \u201ccondo on wheels.\u201dA Toy for the RichJustice Thomas was turned on to the luxury brand by Bernie Little, a fellow Horatio Alger member and the flamboyantly wealthy owner of the Miss Budweiser hydroplane racing boat. Mr. Little had owned 20 to 25 custom motor coaches over the years, Mr. Thomas told C-SPAN in 2001.Back in those days, a basic Prevost Marathon sold for about a million dollars, and could fetch far more depending on the bells and whistles. It was a rich man\u2019s toy, and the company marketed it that way.\u201cYou drive through a neighborhood in South Florida and you see these $10 million homes,\u201d Bob Phebus, Marathon\u2019s vice president, told The South Florida Business Journal in 2006. \u201cYou condense that down, put it on wheels and that\u2019s what we have. It\u2019s the same guy that will have a 100-foot yacht and a private aircraft. They\u2019re accustomed to the finer things in life.\u201dImageA circa 1991 advertisement for Marathon coaches.Credit...MarathonAt the time, the Thomases\u2019 primary source of income was the justice\u2019s salary, then $167,900. He had yet to sell his autobiography, and property and other records show that the couple had significant debt: They had purchased their house in 1992 for $552,000 with 5 percent down, then refinanced it two years later, taking out a 15-year mortgage of $496,000. Plus, they had at least one line of credit of between $15,000 and $50,000.So, in Justice Thomas\u2019s telling, he began searching for a used Prevost at Mr. Little\u2019s suggestion, one with enough miles on it to depreciate the value. \u201cThe depreciation curve \u2014 it\u2019s very steep,\u201d he made a point of saying in the 2001 C-SPAN interview.All these years later, he still hasn\u2019t told some of his closest friends how he was really able to swing the purchase.\u201cHe told me he saved up all his money to buy it,\u201d said Armstrong Williams, a longtime friend who worked closely with Justice Thomas in the Reagan administration.The title history documents reviewed by The Times show that when the motor coach was sold for $267,230 to the Thomases in 1999, it had only 93,618 miles on it, relatively few for a vehicle that experts say can easily log a million miles in its lifetime. It came equipped with plush leather seating, a kitchen, a bathroom and a bedroom in the back. In addition to its orange flame motif, it had a large Pegasus painted on the back, according to Jason Mang, the step-grandson of the previous owner, Bonnie Owenby.\u201cIt was superluxury, really bougie,\u201d he recalled.On Nov. 19, 1999, after spotting the motor coach on the lot of Desert West Coach in Phoenix and putting a hold on it, Justice Thomas attended a dinner at the conservative Goldwater Institute. In a speech that night, he said he had never yearned to be a federal judge. \u201cPure and simple, I wanted to be rich,\u201d he said.Wayne Mullis, the owner of the now-defunct Desert West, said in an interview that Justice Thomas never discussed obtaining traditional financing with him, and that \u201cas far as I know, he paid for it.\u201dIndeed, Justice Thomas would have been hard-pressed to get a loan from a traditional lender. Banks, and even finance companies that specialize in R.V. loans, are particularly reluctant to lend money on used Prevost Marathons because the customized features are hard to value, according to three leading industry executives interviewed by The Times.\u201cAs a rule, the majority of buyers are cash buyers \u2014 they don\u2019t finance the Prevost, generally,\u201d said Chad Stevens, owner of an Arizona-based dealership specializing in high-end motor coaches, whose clients include celebrities and politicians. \u201cIn 1999, you would need a very strong down payment and a strong financial portfolio to finance one. It is a luxury item.\u201dWhile the terms of Mr. Welters\u2019s loan to Justice Thomas are unclear, rules governing loans of more than $10,000 between friends and family are not.Loans can be reclassified as gifts or income to the borrower, either of which would have to be reported by the justice under court disclosure rules, if any portion of the debt is forgiven or discharged as uncollectable. But even if a lender does not take those steps, a loan can still be considered a reportable gift or income if it doesn\u2019t meet certain standards.Loan terms should be spelled out in a written agreement, with a clearly defined, regular repayment schedule, tax experts said. Lenders must charge at least the applicable federal interest rate, which was a little over 6 percent in December 1999, when the deal to buy the motor coach closed. And if a borrower is in arrears, lenders must make a good-faith effort to collect, even to the point of going to court.\u201cAbsent that, it\u2019s more of a gift,\u201d said Rich Lahijani, tax director of Edelman Financial Engines, an independent wealth planning and investment advisory firm.The title history records held by the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles do not contain detailed information about the loan itself. What they show is that when the Thomases drove their motor coach back home to Virginia, they registered it in Prince William County, which does not charge personal property tax on R.V.s stored there, unlike Fairfax County, where they live.ImageMr. Welters said he released the lien on the vehicle in 2008, and provided this photo of the original title to The Times as evidence. (Addresses and vehicle identification number have been redacted.)Credit...via Anthony WeltersAnd as of late last month, when The Times reviewed the records, they still listed Mr. Welters as the lien holder, notwithstanding the signed release he said he gave Justice Thomas in 2008 so he could obtain a new, clear title.Mr. Welters said he could not explain why he was still listed as the holder of the lien. After he gave Justice Thomas the paperwork, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what process the borrower should have followed.\u201d (To clear the title, the paperwork should have been brought to the D.M.V., where the lien release would have been recorded and a replacement title issued.) As for Justice Thomas, that was among the matters he declined to discuss with The Times.\u2018A Warm, Safe Place\u2019As details about Justice and Mrs. Thomas\u2019s subsidized trips to vacation homes and resorts have become public in recent months, his professed preference for traveling by motor coach has become something of a \u201cyeah, right\u201d punchline.But by all accounts, he loves the anonymity, the freedom and the community it affords. He has hosted at least one event at the Supreme Court for a Marathon owners\u2019 club.ImageMembers of the Marathon Coach Club International on the steps of the Supreme Court.Credit...via Marathon CoachWhen he hits the road, he often goes unrecognized, which at times has allowed him to travel without a U.S. Marshals\u2019 security detail. Chris Weaver, who worked at Desert West Coach, said the justice had frequently gotten his motor coach serviced there before it closed. \u201cNine out of 10 times, he was just wearing sweats and a T-shirt,\u201d he said.Traveling largely through red-state America has also meant that when he is recognized, more often than not it is by fans. Juan Williams, a Fox News commentator who has known Justice Thomas since the Reagan administration, said the motor coach was both the fulfillment of a boyish fantasy and a metaphorical \u201cwomb.\u201d\u201cHe talked about the R.V. a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a warm, safe place where he didn\u2019t have to be attacked by liberals and Blacks on the left. What he liked about it was not being pilloried.\u201dImageIn a 2007 interview, Justice Thomas told Steve Kroft of \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that the motor coach enabled him to escape the \u201cmeanness that you see in Washington.\u201dCredit...CBS NewsIn a 2019 Q. and A. at the court, Justice Thomas said he had made it to nearly two dozen states, and declared himself the proud owner of a KOA campground discount card.But the Thomases\u2019 road trips have hardly been limited to sleeping at campsites and Walmart parking lots.In a 2009 call-in to a morning radio talk show, for instance, Mrs. Thomas said they were driving their motor coach through the Adirondacks, on their way to \u201cmeet some families from Texas.\u201d ProPublica has reported that the Thomases have spent part of nearly every summer for the past two decades in the Adirondacks as a guest of Mr. Crow, who owns a lakeside resort there with more than 25 fireplaces, three boathouses and a painting of the justice, his host and other guests smoking cigars.ImageThe boathouse at Harlan Crow\u2019s Adirondack resort, where Justice Thomas and his wife have vacationed.Credit...Nancie Battaglia for The New York TimesWhen the Thomases aren\u2019t houseguests, they have stayed at upscale Marathon-endorsed destinations like the Mountain Falls Luxury Motorcoach Resort in Lake Toxaway, N.C.There, the justice met Larry Fields, who owns a motor-coach-cleaning business. Mr. Fields said that for several days he had had no idea who Justice Thomas was, telling him he would have to wait in line to have his Prevost washed, which he patiently did.\u201cHe was a great guy,\u201d Mr. Fields recalled. \u201cI think we talked about how great Reagan was. He was low-key. It was just him and his wife and a dog.\u201dImageJustice and Mrs. Thomas have traveled to Mountain Falls, a luxury motor coach resort in North Carolina.Credit...Greg EastmanUpkeep on a motor coach like the justice\u2019s is an expensive constant, and other friends have chipped in to help. While he did not disclose Mr. Welters\u2019s assistance in buying the motor coach, he did report that some former clerks got together and bought him deep-cycle batteries for $1,200 the year after he acquired it. He also reported that in 2002, Greg Werner, who ran a large, family-owned, Nebraska-based trucking company, gave him tires worth $1,200.And over time, Justice Thomas made the motor coach his own. In a photo The Times obtained that appears to date back to the early 2000s, picturing his great-nephew as a child, the motor coach no longer sported the sizzling orange flames and Pegasus logo. Instead, it was painted in an elegant black-and-gold geometric pattern.But if the custom coach changed, the justice\u2019s friendship with Mr. Welters endured.While Mr. Welters was an executive at UnitedHealthcare, Justice Thomas twice recused himself from cases involving the company, in 2003 and 2005. As is the general custom of the court, he did not explain why.In 2010, Justice Thomas traveled to the capital of Trinidad and Tobago, Port of Spain, at the invitation of the Welterses. By then, the couple had become major Democratic fund-raisers and President Obama had named Ms. Welters ambassador to the island nation. Local newspapers captured the justice and Mr. Welters talking to students at a school.ImageJustice Thomas at a school in Trinidad and Tobago in 2010 with Mr. Welters, left, whose wife was the ambassador.

But flight records obtained through the plane-tracking services of MyRadar show that the Welterses\u2019 private Gulfstream G-6 flew from Washington Dulles International Airport and back on the days that Justice Thomas arrived on and departed the Caribbean island.And Matthew Cassetta, a retired embassy official who helped arrange the visit, said Ms. Welters customarily \u201coffered the plane to people who came down,\u201d always at her own expense to save the taxpayers money.(Ms. Welters declined to comment on the flights or the loan, except to say, \u201cI just want to tell you that friendships come and go, and that\u2019s what I want to say.\u201d)The same year, in a speech accepting an award from the Horatio Alger Association, Justice Thomas singled out Mr. Welters as one of his \u201cfriends for the whole journey.\u201d\u201cAnd for Tony, a special thank you, who understood relationships and who was always there as a friend in the worst times of my life,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a friendship I will treasure forever.\u201dReporting was contributed by Steve Eder, Riley Mellen, Robin Stein and Abbie VanSickle.Jo Becker is a reporter in the investigative unit and a three-time Pulitzer Prize winner.

Putin holding a child in Kronstadt, near St. Petersburg, last month.Credit...Alexander Demyanchuk/Sputnik, via ReutersBy Paul SonneAug. 5, 2023, 5:01 a.m. ETHe worked a throng of screaming fans in Dagestan. He hoisted a young girl onto his hip in Kronstadt. He posed shoulder-to-shoulder with seven young siblings, shaking their father\u2019s hand after a naval parade.President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is newly out and about, pressing the flesh of the Russian people, in a bid to demonstrate that his years of pandemic-induced isolation are over and that his public support remains strong despite the war in Ukraine and a failed mutiny against his government.His behavior is a noticeable change for the Russian president, who cultivated extreme seclusion during the pandemic, forcing visiting leaders to sit at the opposite end of giant oblong tables and requiring people to quarantine for up to two weeks to see him.The isolation persisted until well after politicians elsewhere had dispensed with such precautions amid receding fears about Covid-19. And once Russia invaded Ukraine, Mr. Putin\u2019s distance stood in stark contrast to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, who made regular visits to frontline positions, crowded ceremonies and cramped hospital rooms.Though many precautions remain in place, and Mr. Putin hardly rivals President Biden on an Iowa rope line, the Russian leader is noticeably interacting with crowds in orchestrated appearances \u2014 portraying himself as in touch and in charge after the rebellion by the Wagner private militia suggested that he was neither.ImageDuring the pandemic, Mr. Putin\u2019s interactions were marked by extreme distancing, as in a meeting in Moscow with President Emmanuel Macron of France in early 2022, in this photo released by the Russian state news media. Credit...Sputnik, via Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\u201cWhat about the quarantine?\u201d a journalist called out to Mr. Putin last month as the Russian leader worked a crowd in Kronstadt.\u201cThe people are more important than quarantine,\u201d Mr. Putin shot back.Mr. Putin has long loathed populist retail politics, deriding the sort of baby kissing required of American politicians campaigning for office as frivolous and vulgar.His attempts at impromptu interaction with the Russian populace over the years have often come off as wooden or peculiar, such as when he lifted the shirt of a young boy and kissed his belly in a 2006 appearance at the Kremlin. (Mr. Putin later said he had wanted to cuddle him like a kitten, a discordant image for a former K.G.B. lieutenant colonel.)The Russian leader has preferred more controlled events, often inspecting production facilities and meeting with worker collectives, holding court over subordinate officials, presiding over military ceremonies or cutting the image of a rugged outdoorsman in carefully orchestrated publicity stunts, sometimes with animals.Much of that active image fell away with the pandemic, when Mr. Putin began to come across as more of a withdrawn autocrat \u2014 beaming in from behind a desk over a flat screen, at one point to launch an ill-planned war.But an aborted June 24 mutiny by Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, the mercenary tycoon, seems to have changed the calculation for the Russian leader.ImageFighters of the Wagner private mercenary group near the headquarters of Russia\u2019s Southern Military District in the city of Rostov-on-Don in June.Credit...ReutersDays after Mr. Prigozhin\u2019s uprising, Mr. Putin traveled to Derbent, a city in Russia\u2019s southern Dagestan region, and appeared before a crowd screaming with delight \u2014 a boisterous encounter the likes of which Russia had not seen from its leader in years.His spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, later said that Mr. Putin had gone against the \u201cstrong recommendations from experts\u201d and made a \u201cfirm decision\u201d to interact with the crowd, because \u201che couldn\u2019t refuse these people and not greet them.\u201dTatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, said the decision to work the crowd was almost certainly Mr. Putin\u2019s personal choice \u2014 designed in part to send the message to Russia\u2019s elite that he maintains the adoration of the nation\u2019s public.\u201cPrigozhin\u2019s rebellion \u2014 that was the strongest blow to the legitimacy of the leadership,\u201d Ms. Stanovaya said. \u201cAnd where does legitimacy come from? From the people. Therefore, the desire to throw oneself into the people and feel you are supported, it\u2019s the kind of need that arises against the backdrop of a rebellion.\u201dMr. Putin\u2019s appearances with crowds have continued in the days since.On July 23, he took the Belarusian president, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, to Kronstadt, a city on an island outside St. Petersburg known for its early-20th-century history of mutinies. The two leaders mingled with a crowd outside a cathedral, where Mr. Putin stood between a bride and groom. He lifted a smiling girl with pink sunglasses on her head.Days later, the Russian president hosted top African leaders in St. Petersburg, his home city.If the summit, with its limited roster of African heads of state, failed to solve Russia\u2019s geopolitical isolation, it did address the enduring images of Mr. Putin\u2019s physical isolation. In a marathon of photo ops, meetings and excursions, the Russian leader had perhaps more sustained personal contact than at any time since before the pandemic, certainly with international officials.The Russian leader glad-handed African leaders of all levels as well as their spouses, hosted a gala dinner and entertained some officials who stayed on for Russia\u2019s traditional Navy Day parade of warships on the Neva River. He returned to Kronstadt flanked by Russian defense officials and African leaders on a crowded boat.On the sidelines of the naval parade, he greeted the Gorelov family from Magadan, in Russia\u2019s far east. The parents a day earlier had received the Order of Parental Glory for raising 10 children, part of a long-running Russian state effort to combat demographic decline by promoting \u201cmulti-child families.\u201dMr. Putin slipped in between the seven children the Gorelovs had brought for a photograph.In recent days, Mr. Putin has alternated between appearances that address the war and interactions with crowds that seem designed to communicate normalcy and demonstrate that he broadly retains the population\u2019s loyalty, even as the war causes continued hardship that has fueled discontent for many Russians.On Wednesday, he appeared before widows whose husbands had died in the war, brushing his hand over the head of a fallen soldier\u2019s young daughter and patting the shoulder of the boy next to her.ImageMembers of the public waved as Mr. Putin and the Russian defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, passed by on a boat while reviewing a naval parade during celebrations in St. Petersburg last month.Credit...Anatoly Maltsev/EPA, via ShutterstockBy the standards of most world politicians, Mr. Putin\u2019s encounters with crowds are still limited. Mr. Zelensky, by comparison, follows a schedule packed with public interactions. A busy American presidential candidate might interact with more public crowds in a week than Mr. Putin has in the past year.But by the Russian leader\u2019s recent standards, the change is noticeable.Sam Greene, director for democratic resilience at the Center for European Policy Analysis in Washington, said that Mr. Putin might be ramping up his public activity before the presidential election next March. It will be the Russian leader\u2019s fifth, though he has yet to announce his candidacy officially.With a system that has neutralized competitors over the years, Mr. Putin will undoubtedly win, but the Kremlin will still monitor turnout and victory margins \u2014 as will the Russian elite Mr. Putin must keep on side.\u201cYou\u2019ve got all of these oligarchs and people throughout the system who are rich and powerful and unaccountable \u2014 and that is all made possible by the fact that you\u2019ve got somebody up on the stage who is keeping the show going,\u201d Mr. Greene said. \u201cHe needs to communicate to the elite that not only is he good at doing that \u2014 but it\u2019s not even close.\u201dPaul Sonne is a foreign correspondent for The Times, focusing on Russia and Ukraine.

Fahrenthold,\u00a0Lynsey Chutel and Ishaan JhaveriMara Hvistendahl is an investigative reporter focused on China. David A. Fahrenthold investigates nonprofits from Washington. Lynsey Chutel reported from South Africa and Ishaan Jhaveri from New York.Aug. 5, 2023The protest in London\u2019s bustling Chinatown brought together a variety of activist groups to oppose a rise in anti-Asian hate crimes. So it was peculiar when a street brawl broke out among mostly ethnic Chinese demonstrators.Witnesses said the fight, in November 2021, started when men aligned with the event\u2019s organizers, including a group called No Cold War, attacked activists supporting the democracy movement in Hong Kong.On the surface, No Cold War is a loose collective run mostly by American and British activists who say the West\u2019s rhetoric against China has distracted from issues like climate change and racial injustice.In fact, a New York Times investigation found, it is part of a lavishly funded influence campaign that defends China and pushes its propaganda. At the center is a charismatic American millionaire, Neville Roy Singham, who is known as a socialist benefactor of far-left causes.What is less known, and is hidden amid a tangle of nonprofit groups and shell companies, is that Mr. Singham works closely with the Chinese government media machine and is financing its propaganda worldwide.From a think tank in Massachusetts to an event space in Manhattan, from a political party in South Africa to news organizations in India and Brazil, The Times tracked hundreds of millions of dollars to groups linked to Mr. Singham that mix progressive advocacy with Chinese government talking points.Some, like No Cold War, popped up in recent years. Others, like the American antiwar group Code Pink, have morphed over time. Code Pink once criticized China\u2019s rights record but now defends its internment of the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs, which human rights experts have labeled a crime against humanity.These groups are funded through American nonprofits flush with at least $275 million in donations.But Mr. Singham, 69, himself sits in Shanghai, where one outlet in his network is co-producing a YouTube show financed in part by the city\u2019s propaganda department. Two others are working with a Chinese university to \u201cspread China\u2019s voice to the world.\u201d And last month, Mr. Singham joined a Communist Party workshop about promoting the party internationally.ImageProtesters in Chinatown, London, in 2021. One of the groups that organized the protest, No Cold War, has links to Mr. Singham.Credit...Picture Capital/AlamyMr. Singham says he does not work at the direction of the Chinese government. But the line between him and the propaganda apparatus is so blurry that he shares office space \u2014 and his groups share staff members \u2014 with a company whose goal is to educate foreigners about \u201cthe miracles that China has created on the world stage.\u201dYears of research have shown how disinformation, both homegrown and foreign-backed, influences mainstream conservative discourse. Mr. Singham\u2019s network shows what that process looks like on the left.He and his allies are on the front line of what Communist Party officials call a \u201csmokeless war.\u201d Under the rule of Xi Jinping, China has expanded state media operations, teamed up with overseas outlets and cultivated foreign influencers. The goal is to disguise propaganda as independent content.Mr. Singham\u2019s groups have produced YouTube videos that, together, racked up millions of views. They also seek to influence real-world politics by meeting with congressional aides, training politicians in Africa, running candidates in South African elections and organizing protests like the one in London that erupted into violence.The result is a seemingly organic bloom of far-left groups that echo Chinese government talking points, echo one another, and are echoed in turn by the Chinese state media.Because the network is built on the back of American nonprofit groups, tax experts said, Mr. Singham may have been eligible for tax deductions for his donations.The Times untangled the web of charities and shell companies using nonprofit and corporate filings, internal documents and interviews with over two dozen former employees of groups linked to Mr. Singham. Some groups, including No Cold War, do not seem to exist as legal entities but are tied to the network through domain registration records and shared organizers.None of Mr. Singham\u2019s nonprofits have registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, as is required of groups that seek to influence public opinion on behalf of foreign powers. That usually applies to groups taking money or orders from foreign governments. Legal experts said Mr. Singham\u2019s network was an unusual case.Most of the groups in Mr. Singham\u2019s network declined to answer questions from The Times. Three said they had never received money or instructions from a foreign government or political party.Speculation about Mr. Singham first emerged on Twitter among self-described anti-fascists. Reports followed in the publication New Lines and the South African investigative outlet amaBhungane. The authorities in India raided a news organization tied to Mr. Singham during a crackdown on the press, accusing it of having ties to the Chinese government but offering no proof.The Times investigation is the first to unravel the funding and document Mr. Singham\u2019s ties to Chinese propaganda interests.Mr. Singham did not offer substantive answers to questions about those ties. He said he abided by the tax laws in countries where he was active.\u201cI categorically deny and repudiate any suggestion that I am a member of, work for, take orders from, or follow instructions of any political party or government or their representatives,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cI am solely guided by my beliefs, which are my long-held personal views.\u201dIndeed, his associates say Mr. Singham has long admired Maoism, the Communist ideology that gave rise to modern China. He praised Venezuela under the leftist president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez as a \u201cphenomenally democratic place.\u201d And a decade before moving to China, he said the world could learn from its governing approach.The son of a leftist academic, Archibald Singham, Mr. Singham is a longtime activist who founded the Chicago-based software consultancy Thoughtworks.There, Mr. Singham came across as a charming showman who prided himself on creating an egalitarian corporate culture. He was unabashed about his politics. A former company technical director, Majdi Haroun, recalled Mr. Singham lecturing him on the Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara. Mr. Haroun said employees sometimes jokingly called each other \u201ccomrade.\u201dIn 2017, Mr. Singham married Jodie Evans, a former Democratic political adviser and the co-founder of Code Pink. The wedding, in Jamaica, was a \u201cWho\u2019s Who\u201d of progressivism. Photos from the event show Amy Goodman, host of \u201cDemocracy Now!\u201d; Ben Cohen, co-founder of Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream; and V, the playwright formerly known as Eve Ensler, who wrote \u201cThe Vagina Monologues.\u201dIt was also a working event. The invitation described a panel discussion called \u201cThe Future of the Left.\u201dImageA screen grab of the wedding website \u2014 Mr. Singham goes by Roy \u2014 with a scheduled panel discussion called \u201cThe Future of the Left.\u201dCredit...oneloveunionjodieandroy.comMr. Singham had a plan for that future. He had quietly funded left-wing causes while at Thoughtworks. But his activism was about to intensify. Six months after his wedding, he sold Thoughtworks to a private equity firm. A copy of the sale agreement put the price at $785 million.\u201cI decided that at my age and extreme privilege, the best thing I could do was to give away most of my money in my lifetime,\u201d he said in his statement.The Network Takes ShapeWhile other moguls slapped their names on foundations, Mr. Singham sent his money through a system that concealed his giving.At its center were four new nonprofits with dust-dry names like \u201cUnited Community Fund\u201d and \u201cJustice and Education Fund.\u201d They have almost no real-world footprints, listing their addresses only as UPS store mailboxes in Illinois, Wisconsin and New York.Because American nonprofit groups do not need to disclose individual donors, these four nonprofits worked like a financial geyser, throwing out a shower of money from an invisible source.In their public filings, none list Mr. Singham as a board member or donor. \u201cI do not control them,\u201d he said in his statement, \u201calthough I have been known to share my opinions.\u201dIn reality, Mr. Singham has close ties to all four.The largest is run by Ms. Evans. The group\u2019s founding bylaws say that Mr. Singham can fire her and the rest of the board. They also require that the group dissolve after Mr. Singham\u2019s death.ImageJodie Evans in Washington in 2019. She is a former Democratic political adviser and the co-founder of the group Code Pink.Credit...Leigh Green/AlamyThe other three groups were founded by former Thoughtworks employees, according to interviews with other former Thoughtworks staff members and r\u00e9sum\u00e9s posted online.In his statement, Mr. Singham acknowledged giving his money to unnamed intermediaries that fit the description of these four UPS store nonprofits. And several groups that received donations from them have identified Mr. Singham as the source.One of them is the Massachusetts-based think tank Tricontinental. Its executive director, Vijay Prashad, recounted Mr. Singham\u2019s financing in 2021. \u201cA Marxist with a massive software company!\u201d he wrote on Twitter.Tricontinental produces videos and articles on socialist issues. Mr. Prashad did not answer questions about Mr. Singham, but said the organization followed the law. \u201cWe do not and have never received funds or instructions from any government or political party,\u201d he said in a statement.From the UPS store nonprofits, millions of dollars flowed around the world. The Times tracked money to a South African political party, YouTube channels in the United States and nonprofits in Ghana and Zambia. In Brazil, records show, money flowed to a group that produces a publication, Brasil de Fato, that intersperses articles about land rights with praise for Xi Jinping.In New Delhi, corporate filings show, Mr. Singham\u2019s network financed a news site, NewsClick, that sprinkled its coverage with Chinese government talking points. \u201cChina\u2019s history continues to inspire the working classes,\u201d one video said.These groups operate in coordination. They have cross-posted articles and shared one another\u2019s content on social media hundreds of times. Many share staff members and office space. They organize events together and interview one another\u2019s representatives without disclosing their ties.\u2018Hijacked\u2019 in South AfricaSeveral times a year, activists and politicians from across Africa fly to South Africa for boot camps at the Nkrumah School, set in a popular safari area.They come to learn to organize workers and left-wing movements. Once on campus, though, some attendees are surprised to find Chinese topics seeping into the curriculum.At a recent session, reading packets said that the United States was waging a \u201chybrid war\u201d against China by distorting information about Hong Kong, Taiwan and the Xinjiang region where Uyghurs were held in camps.The packets praised Chinese loans, calling them \u201can opportunity for African states to construct genuine, and sovereign, development projects.\u201d No mention was made of China\u2019s role in a recent debt crisis in Zambia.\u201cThey\u2019re being rounded up to be fed Chinese propaganda,\u201d said Cebelihle Mbuyisa, a former employee who helped prepare materials for the workshop. \u201cWhole social movements on the African continent are being hijacked by what looks like a foreign policy instrument of the Chinese Communist Party.\u201dThose who objected were shouted down or not invited back, four past attendees said.U.S. tax records show that one of the UPS store nonprofits, the People\u2019s Support Foundation, donated at least $450,000 for training at the school. On Instagram, Ms. Evans described a photo of the grounds as \u201cRoy\u2019s new place.\u201dThe $450,000 was just part of Mr. Singham\u2019s efforts in South Africa. In all, the foundation has sent $5.6 million to groups that run the school; a news organization; and the Socialist Revolutionary Workers Party, a fringe party launched ahead of the 2019 election.Former party members said they were perplexed that, despite severe local unemployment and poverty, the party seemed interested in China. Mr. Singham, for example, urged them to attend an online lecture by a Chinese academic, Li Bo of Fudan University, an email shows.After a party member called China\u2019s presence in Africa \u201ca second colonization,\u201d leaders responded defensively in a WhatsApp group. \u201cWhen it came to us questioning certain behaviors from the Chinese state, that was a no-no,\u201d said Lindiwe Mkhumbane, a former member.In a statement, the party said its members have attended workshops on progressive issues but that it had never forced anyone to attend.Mr. Singham also funded an online news start-up, New Frame, according to a recording obtained by The Times. One employee, Aragorn Eloff, said Mr. Singham interviewed him for a job.The outlet hired talented reporters and paid them well. Readership was small, but the stated goal was \u201cquality, not clicks.\u201dIts former top editor has denied that New Frame had a pro-China slant. But a former reporter, Anna Majavu, said that an editor removed criticism of Chinese labor practices from a story on mining. \u201cThe resistance from the editor was purely political,\u201d she said.And in June 2022, an editor, Darryl Accone, wrote a resignation letter criticizing New Frame\u2019s soft coverage of China and Russia. The \u201cunavoidable conclusion,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis that this is an ideological directive emanating from above and outside New Frame.\u201d\u2018Always Follow the Party\u2019Mr. Singham\u2019s office, adorned in red and yellow, sits on the 18th floor of Shanghai\u2019s swanky Times Square.A visit shows that he is not alone.He shares the office with a Chinese media company called Maku Group, which says its goal is to \u201ctell China\u2019s story well,\u201d a term commonly used for foreign propaganda. In a Chinese-language job advertisement, Maku says it produces text, audio and videos for \u201cglobal networks of popular media and progressive think tanks.\u201dIt can be hard to tell where Maku begins and Mr. Singham\u2019s groups end.Nonprofit filings show that nearly $1.8 million flowed from one of the UPS store nonprofits to Maku Group. And in 2021, according to a Chinese-language news release, Maku and Tricontinental agreed to work with a Shanghai university to \u201ctell China\u2019s story\u201d in Chinese and English.Maku\u2019s website shows young people gathering in Mr. Singham\u2019s office, facing a red banner that reads, in Chinese, \u201cAlways Follow the Party.\u201d Resting on a shelf is a plate depicting Xi Jinping.Maku Group did not respond to a request to comment. After The Times began asking questions, its website went down for maintenance.In 2020, Mr. Singham emailed his friends to introduce a newsletter, now called Dongsheng News, that covers China in English, French, Spanish and Portuguese. Drawing stories from the state media, it blends lighthearted news with bureaucratic official prose.Dongsheng\u2019s editors, in China, come from Tricontinental, but its address leads to the People\u2019s Forum, a Manhattan event space also funded by Mr. Singham. Dongsheng \u201cprovides unique progressive coverage of China that has been sadly missing,\u201d Mr. Singham told friends.His ties to the propaganda machine date back at least to 2019, when, corporate documents show, he started a consulting business with Chinese partners. Those partners are active in the propaganda apparatus, co-owning with the municipal government of Tongren a media company that promotes anti-poverty policies.The small, southwest city of Tongren might seem a niche topic. But organizations in Mr. Singham\u2019s network have published at least a dozen items about peasants there.Code PinkMs. Evans, 68, was once a Democratic insider who managed the 1992 presidential campaign of the California governor Jerry Brown.After the 2001 terrorist attacks, she reinvented herself as an activist. She became known for pink peace-sign earrings and sit-ins that ended with her arrest.She helped form Code Pink to protest the looming war in Iraq. The group became notorious for disrupting Capitol Hill hearings.Ms. Evans has organized around progressive causes like climate change, gender and racism. Until a few years ago, she readily criticized China\u2019s authoritarian government.\u201cWe demand China stop brutal repression of their women\u2019s human rights defenders,\u201d she wrote on Twitter in 2015. She later posted on Instagram a photo with the Chinese dissident Ai Weiwei.ImageA demonstrator from Code Pink interrupted witness testimony during a House committee hearing in February.Credit...Anna Rose Layden/BloombergSince 2017, about a quarter of Code Pink\u2019s donations \u2014 more than $1.4 million \u2014 have come from two groups linked to Mr. Singham, nonprofit records show. The first was one of the UPS store nonprofits. The second was a charity that Goldman Sachs offers as a conduit for clients\u2019 giving, and that Mr. Singham has used in the past.Ms. Evans now stridently supports China. She casts it as a defender of the oppressed and a model for economic growth without slavery or war. \u201cIf the U.S. crushes China,\u201d she said in 2021, it \u201cwould cut off hope for the human race and life on Earth.\u201dShe describes the Uyghurs as terrorists and defends their mass detention. \u201cWe have to do something,\u201d she said in 2021. In a recent YouTube video chat, she was asked if she had anything negative to say about China.\u201cI can\u2019t, for the life of me, think of anything,\u201d Ms. Evans responded. She ultimately had one complaint: She had trouble using China\u2019s phone-based payment apps.Ms. Evans declined to answer questions about funding from her husband but said Code Pink had never taken money from any government. \u201cI deny your suggestion that I follow the direction of any political party, my husband or any other government or their representatives,\u201d she said in a written statement. \u201cI have always followed my values.\u201dFew on the American political left would discuss the couple publicly, fearing lawsuits or harassment. Others said that criticism would undermine progressive causes. But Howie Hawkins, the 2020 Green Party presidential nominee, said he had soured on Code Pink and others in the Singham network that presented themselves as pro-labor but supported governments that suppressed workers. \u201cTo defend that, or excuse that, really pushes them outside what the left ought to be,\u201d he said.Code Pink is not alone among left-wing groups in raising concerns about anti-Asian discrimination and tensions between Beijing and Washington.But Code Pink goes further, defending the Chinese government\u2019s policies. In a 2021 video, a staff member compared Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy demonstrators to the rioters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 that year.In June, Code Pink activists visited staff members on the House Select Committee on China unannounced. In the office of Representative Seth Moulton, Democrat of Massachusetts, activists denied evidence of forced labor in Xinjiang and said the congressman should visit and see how happy people were there, according to an aide.\u201cThey are capitalizing on very legitimate concerns in order to push this pro-authoritarian narrative,\u201d said Brian Hioe, an editor with New Bloom, a progressive Taiwanese news site. \u201cAnd their ideas end up circulating in a way that affects mainstream discourse.\u201dChinese state media accounts have retweeted people and organizations in Mr. Singham\u2019s network at least 122 times since February 2020, a Times analysis found, mostly accounts connected with No Cold War and Code Pink.This May, Mr. Singham attended the opening of a media institute in Shanghai. Organizers distributed tote bags reading \u201cCommunications as solidarity.\u201dImageThis photo, from the Chinese news site Guancha, shows Mr. Singham, front right, at a breakout session last month during a Chinese Communist Party forum.Credit...guancha.cnA photo shows Mr. Singham sitting up front, next to Yu Yunquan, an official from a publishing group under the Communist Party\u2019s powerful Central Committee.Just last month, Mr. Singham attended a Chinese Communist Party propaganda forum.

But was it true?Credit...Model and photograph by Nix + GerberSupported bySKIP ADVERTISEMENTGive this article63By Charles HomansAug. 5, 2023For months a sort of aerosolized fury had hung over the Loudoun County school district. There were fights over Covid closures and mask mandates, over racial-equity programs, over library books. Now, in the weeks before the school board\u2019s meeting on June 22, 2021, attention had shifted to a new proposal: Policy 8040, which would let transgender students choose pronouns, play sports and use bathrooms in accordance with their declared gender identity. In May, an elementary-school gym teacher announced that as a \u201cservant of God,\u201d he felt he could not follow the policy. The district swiftly suspended him \u2014 and just as swiftly, the antennae of conservative media outlets and politicians swiveled toward Loudoun County.Listen to This ArticleFor more audio journalism and storytelling, download New York Times Audio, a new iOS app available for news subscribers.The entire Republican ticket for that fall\u2019s statewide elections made a pilgrimage to Loudoun, a swath of Washington exurbs in Northern Virginia that is the highest-median-income county in America and the fourth-most-populous in the state. \u201cFox & Friends\u201d broadcast live from a local diner. \u201cThis won\u2019t stop in #LoudounCounty,\u201d the Family Foundation of Virginia, a conservative religious organization in Richmond, tweeted. \u201cIt\u2019s coming to your schools and children too.\u201d County Democrats urged supporters of the proposed policy to make their own voices heard at the upcoming meeting, and everyone descended upon the school administration building in the town of Ashburn.Inside, the room looked like Facebook come to life. There were \u201cmama bears\u201d and dads in tactical-themed leisure apparel and signs proclaiming solidarity with \u201cWe the Parents.\u201d There were rainbow-flag face masks and Black Lives Matter T-shirts and buttons affirming the many other tenets of yard-sign liberalism. It was rare that the warring ideological tribes of suburbia actually met each other on an offline field of battle, and TV crews were on hand to document the occasion.\u201cThat meeting,\u201d Beth Barts, a member of the school board at the time, later recalled, \u201cjust went to hell.\u201d During the public-comment period, a Republican former state legislator accused the board of \u201cteaching children to hate others because of their skin color\u201d and \u201cforcing them to lie about other kids\u2019 gender.\u201d When the crowd, which had been warned against disruptions, cheered, the board voted to end public comment. The crowd booed loudly. A man in the third row stood and extended both middle fingers at the board members, who were hastily ushered into a secure back room.Scanning the scene for signs of trouble, a sheriff\u2019s deputy named Timothy Iversen saw a middle-aged man in a plumbing-company T-shirt arguing over a row of chairs with a woman wearing a top emblazoned with a rainbow heart. \u201cYou\u2019re a bitch,\u201d the man said, clenching his fist.Iversen grabbed him by the arm, but he resisted. Another deputy rushed in, and the two officers tackled the man, crashing through chairs. The second deputy punched him several times. A third knelt on his back. Pinned beneath the deputies, the man screamed that he couldn\u2019t breathe. His mouth was smeared with blood. The man\u2019s wife stood nearby. \u201cMy child was raped at school!\u201d she shouted. \u201cAnd this is what happens!\u201dAfter the deputies arrested the man and loaded him into their van, his wife explained the situation. Their names were Scott and Jessica Smith, and they owned a small plumbing business in Leesburg, a nearby town. Weeks earlier, their 15-year-old daughter was sexually assaulted by a boy in a girls\u2019 bathroom at her high school in Ashburn. The boy was wearing a skirt.\u201cI wasn\u2019t even concerned about the fact that it was a boy wearing a skirt in the girls\u2019 bathroom at the time,\u201d Scott Smith later told me. \u201cI\u2019m focused on the fact that my daughter just got raped.\u201d On the day of the assault, he went to the school and erupted at the principal. A sheriff\u2019s deputy assigned as the school resource officer escorted him out of the building. After that, Smith found himself subject to what seemed to him to be a series of escalating affronts. When Loudoun County Public Schools sent an email later that day to Stone Bridge families to inform them of an incident there, it was about Smith\u2019s outburst and made no mention of a sexual assault.At the June 22 school-board meeting, Smith said, the woman he was confronting when the deputy grabbed him \u2014 a mother whose daughter had been in a Girl Scout troop led by his wife \u2014 had called him a liar and threatened to ruin his plumbing business on social media. The school authorities, too, seemed to deny that the assault occurred at all.\u201cDo we have assaults in our bathrooms or locker rooms regularly?\u201d Barts, the school-board member, asked when the board reconvened later that evening in an empty chamber and discussed the transgender policy.\u201cTo my knowledge, we don\u2019t have any record of assaults occurring in our restrooms,\u201d Scott Ziegler, the schools\u2019 superintendent, replied. But Ziegler knew there was an investigation underway into the assault of Smith\u2019s daughter, and he had notified the school-board members.In time, Smith came to believe that he knew why all this happened. So did Smith\u2019s many champions in conservative media and Republican politics. The assault of his daughter, they would argue, revealed a hidden architecture of power: the power that liberal elites had accrued in the school system of Loudoun County and counties like it all over the country. They were wielding that power to force bewildering cultural changes upon not just schools but American society as a whole, through measures like Loudoun County\u2019s proposed Policy 8040. \u201cIt was clear,\u201d Scott Walker, the Republican former governor of Wisconsin, wrote about the Loudoun County episode in a 2022 Washington Times op-ed, \u201cthat the school board and administrators were more concerned about furthering their transgender agenda than protecting the safety of students.\u201dThe particulars of Smith\u2019s daughter\u2019s case \u2014 an attacker in a skirt, a girls\u2019 bathroom \u2014 posed an obvious threat to the new policy. And so, critics charged, school officials buried it, and because they buried it, more harm was done. When it all came to light months later, this theory of the case would galvanize a local conservative parents\u2019-rights movement, help swing a governor\u2019s race and rattle the politics of gender in America far beyond Virginia.This was one version of the story of Loudoun County. But as prosecutors took up the matter over the next two years, a different story began to take shape \u2014 one that is told here based on court records and testimony, as well as months of interviews with participants in the events at the heart of the scandal, in some cases discussing them on the record for the first time, and hundreds of pages of documents obtained through public-records requests. This evidence presents a much more complicated picture of what happened, in Loudoun County and beyond, in a period of escalating culture wars that have consumed the same communities and institutions that the combatants insist they want to save.ImageJessica and Scott Smith, whose 15-year-old daughter was sexually assaulted in a bathroom at Stone Bridge High School in Ashburn, Va.Credit...Matt Eich for The New York TimesLoudoun County\u2019s current population of about 432,000, larger than that of New Orleans, is five times what it was in 1990. Starting in the late \u201990s, a combination of cheap land and cheap electricity made Ashburn, a small community originally known as Farmville, into the East Coast hub for the data-center industry. The Iraq and Afghanistan wars and post-financial-crisis stimulus spending, meanwhile, created a federal contracting bonanza that enriched Washington\u2019s economy and pushed suburban expansion deeper into the Beltway\u2019s rural periphery. The transformation has been so recent and total that the fastest-growing suburbs in Loudoun tend to resemble architectural renderings of themselves: arteries of immaculate asphalt lined with evenly spaced cherry saplings, tessellations of residential subdivisions with near-identical fake colonials.Loudoun County\u2019s new professional class pulled the once solidly Republican county\u2019s politics leftward, and in 2018, a resignation ended the Republican majority on the school board. (School-board elections are nonpartisan, but candidates usually run with local party endorsements.) The next year\u2019s election gave the Democrats seven of nine board seats, one of which went to Beth Barts.\u201cI never got involved in politics ever,\u201d Barts told me in June at a Starbucks in Leesburg. She ran for the school board, she said, \u201cbecause I felt like Leesburg was changing, based on all of the development.\u201d But when Barts took office, the district\u2019s growing pains were not what seemed to animate the people who came to school-board meetings. The Loudoun County schools had recently been drawn into several controversies over race and gender: uproars over an Underground Railroad-themed game in an elementary-school gym class, a D.E.I. consultant\u2019s critical report, a diverse-books initiative by school libraries that led to complaints from local conservatives, mostly about L.G.B.T.Q.-themed books. These sorts of episodes were not unique to Loudoun County, but when they happened there, people tended to notice. Northern Virginia was the ancestral haven of Washington conservatives, and they had taken the region\u2019s leftward drift personally, as a kind of dispossession.Andrea Weiskopf, a middle-school English teacher and vocal critic of the conservative activism in the school district, pointed out that this heightened, politicized attention came at a moment when the school district was fast losing its small-town intimacy and trust and taking on an exurban impersonality. Half of the district\u2019s 18 high schools opened in 2010 or later. In 2014, the superintendent who ran the district for nearly a quarter century \u2014 a Loudoun County native who \u201cknew everyone\u2019s sister\u2019s dog\u2019s name,\u201d Weiskopf said \u2014 retired. His successors were less familiar, which made their forays into racial equity and gender inclusivity seem less familiar still.During the Covid-19 lockdown, Loudoun County descended into a bitter struggle over reopening schools. As that fight grew tangled up in fights over equity programs, critical race theory and gender policies, Loudoun County became regular fodder for Fox News and other conservative outlets. Parent groups proliferated on Facebook, arrayed on either side of the county\u2019s, and America\u2019s, hardening partisan identity politics.One of them, a private group called Anti-Racist Parents of Loudoun County, included a number of local Democratic officials, Barts among them. Barts did not consider herself especially partisan. But she also said what she thought, and, as one former school-board member told me, \u201cshe was always \u2014 always \u2014 online.\u201d In March 2021, she warned in a post to the group that \u201cthis CRT\u2009\u2018movement\u2019 for lack of a better word is gaining support.\u201d Another member of the group began crowdsourcing a list of people on the other side of the local fights over race and Covid and put out a call for \u201chackers who can shut down their websites or direct them to pro-CRT/anti-racist information pages.\u201d Inevitably, the conversation leaked to the people on the list. Most fatefully, it leaked to a man named Ian Prior.A lawyer turned public-relations and political consultant, Prior was a former spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, the conservative American Crossroads super PAC and the Trump administration\u2019s Department of Justice. He had two young daughters in the Loudoun County public schools and had dipped a toe into local school politics in the fall of 2020, writing a piece for the right-wing site The Federalist denouncing the school district\u2019s racial-equity efforts.\u201cMost parents aren\u2019t fully engaged in this,\u201d Prior told me over coffee this spring at a Barnes & Noble cafe in Ashburn. Only a relative sliver fully shared the concerns of the activists. \u201cIt\u2019s 10 percent here, 10 percent there,\u201d he said, gesturing to his right and left. The school fights were, ultimately, a \u201cbattle between those 10 percents.\u201dThe problem for liberals was, paradoxically, that they had largely won the battle of the 10 percents. Educational pedagogy and the administrative class had rapidly become suffused with ideas, particularly about race and gender, that were unfamiliar and often radical to many if not most people, even many who thought of themselves as liberal and inclusive. And they were often encountering these ideas for the first time through the opaque bureaucracy of the school system.The outlet for their unease was the school board, the rare place where that system meets electoral accountability. And in the antiracist Facebook group, Prior saw opportunity. Because the private group included more than two school-board members, he reasoned, they were potentially in violation of open-meeting laws. He organized a new parents\u2019-rights group he called Fight for Schools and began a campaign to recall Democratic school-board members, starting with Beth Barts.The recall effort would also serve as a kind of political narrative device, for keeping attention on the district\u2019s policymakers. \u201cThere\u2019s a disconnect between what they\u2019re doing and what parents want,\u201d Prior told me of the school administrators. \u201cWhat did we do? We just brought attention to it in a major way.\u201dThe spring of 2021 was a fraught, jittery moment in the county schools. Aside from the politics swirling around the district, staff members were navigating the return to full-time in-person instruction, which had just begun for some students, and the social problems that followed a year of isolation. It was in this context that on May 12, a teacher\u2019s assistant at Stone Bridge High School wrote an email to her department chairwoman.There was a boy in her class, the teacher\u2019s assistant wrote, who \u201cseems to have a problem with listening and keeping his hands to himself.\u201d He had come into class more than once with his arm around a girl\u2019s neck. \u201cI have caught him sitting on other girls\u2019 laps several times,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI understand that the school year is quickly ending, and that students and staff alike are counting down the days, but if this kind of reckless behavior persists, I wouldn\u2019t want to be held accountable if someone should get hurt.\u201dImageStone Bridge High School became the focus of Loudoun County\u2019s fight over a new transgender policy.Credit...Matt Eich for The New York Times\u201cHe was always kind of doing his own thing,\u201d the mother of the boy told me recently, picking at a muffin in a supermarket food court. \u201cThat\u2019s always been the challenge with him.\u201d She had done what she could, she said, had tried to work with his teachers. But what could she do when he was at school? \u201cAs parents,\u201d she said, \u201cwe can\u2019t fix it if we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.\u201dAs she saw it, the hall passes were the start of the trouble. There was an app on the school-issued laptops that allowed students to check out of class. When they did, teachers seemed not to watch closely how long they were gone \u2014 a fact her son, 14 at the time, had quickly come to understand. So had a girl he met through mutual friends early that spring.She had recently transferred to Stone Bridge from a school in Leesburg, after an incident the previous fall in which she said several teenage boys in the neighborhood had threatened her, according to Scott Smith, her father. Smith said that he and his wife sought psychiatric care for her after the incident. In a meeting with school staff members, they explained that their daughter \u201cneeded extra supervision,\u201d he said. \u201cThey assured us they would keep an eye on her.\u201dLate on the morning of May 28, the Friday before Memorial Day weekend, the girl messaged the boy from her school laptop, according to court records.\u201cBro I\u2019m so bored,\u201d she wrote.They had slipped out of class before to meet in girls\u2019 bathrooms around the school. They had met in a stall to have sex at least once before, and this morning, the boy suggested something similar.\u201cWe could call a pass,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHave some \u2018fun\u2019\u201d\u201cMaybe,\u201d the girl wrote back.\u201cMaybe\u201d\u201cWhere doe\u201d\u201cWhat about the bathrooms by the Tech Ed classroom?\u201d he proposed.The girl hesitated for a moment before replying, \u201cI\u2019ll meet u but I\u2019m not promises anything\u201d\u201cWait for me,\u201d she added.An hour and a half later, at 1:28 p.m., Tim Flynn, the school principal, emailed two district administrators. \u201cI have a female student who alleges another student attempted to rape her in the bathroom today,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are sending this to law enforcement. The girl is currently with the nurse.\u201dMonths later, in juvenile court, the girl would testify that she and the boy had met in the handicapped stall of the girls\u2019 bathroom. When the boy began to touch her, she resisted. The boy became more aggressive, she said. He lay her down on her stomach on the floor and anally penetrated her.At that moment, a teacher\u2019s assistant came into the bathroom, and the boy jumped up. The woman would later testify that she saw two pairs of feet beneath the stall door but thought little of it; pairs of girls were often in a stall together. After she left, the boy forced the girl to perform oral sex on him, the girl said. They left the bathroom at the same time, and the girl went to the nurse\u2019s office.Tavis Henry, the sheriff\u2019s deputy who served as the school resource officer for Stone Bridge, had just begun to interview the girl when her mother arrived, followed later by her father. Scott Smith had an employee drive him to the school, and he began shouting when school staff denied him entrance because he didn\u2019t have his driver\u2019s license. When Henry came out to meet him, Smith told me, he told the officer: \u201cI\u2019m coming through the door. [Expletive] tackle me or escort me. Your choice.\u201dWhen Smith met Flynn outside the main office, he was \u201cenraged \u2014 very loud,\u201d Flynn testified in court. \u201cHe wanted to know where the boy was that had done this.\u201d He was acting aggressively enough toward Flynn that Henry placed himself between them. \u201cI was upset,\u201d Smith acknowledged. Henry called for more deputies and walked Smith out of the building.Until recently, the only detailed firsthand account of the confrontation to be made public was Smith\u2019s own, which would shape much of the political narrative around the sexual assault. In his telling, Henry and the school authorities had seemed frozen and inattentive to the task of investigating his daughter\u2019s assault until Smith arrived, demanding action. In court this June, Flynn and Henry gave a different account. Smith\u2019s belligerence, Henry said, made him \u201cshift my attention\u201d away from investigating the assault. And his outburst had occurred within earshot of students, many of them with phones and social media accounts. \u201cThis was bad,\u201d Flynn recalled thinking.Flynn and the district administrators hurried to put out a statement before the inevitable rumors started. The email to district families mentioned the incident with Smith, though it did not name him, and it made no mention of the sexual assault. This was, district officials later testified, not a strategic omission, but rather a reflection of school policy, given that the episode was under investigation. And school staff members remained uncertain about what exactly occurred in the bathroom.Henry\u2019s interview of the girl had been cut short by her parents\u2019 arrival \u2014 she would not be interviewed by a detective until later that afternoon \u2014 and he would later testify that he at first assumed that the bathroom encounter was consensual; he had seen the same boy and girl holding hands in the hallway in the past. Wayde Byard, the school district\u2019s public-information officer, later testified that it was, \u201cas far as we knew, a boyfriend-girlfriend situation that had somehow gone in the wrong direction.\u201d (Smith disputed that his daughter had anything resembling a relationship with the boy. \u201cThey were never boyfriend-girlfriend,\u201d he said.) Dispatch records from the sheriff\u2019s office that day described the incident in cautious terms, reporting that the girl had \u201cmade allegations of being possibly raped or touched unwanted by another student.\u201dThere was one detail, though, that seemed to concern school administrators immediately. The boy, when he entered the girls\u2019 bathroom, was wearing a skirt.It was this fact that prompted Kevin Lewis, the district\u2019s chief operations officer, to email several of the district\u2019s top administrators that afternoon, announcing that he was convening a virtual meeting to discuss the situation.\u201cThe incident at SBHS,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis related to policy 8040.\u201dImageBeth Barts says she ran for a seat on the Loudoun County School Board \u201cbecause I felt like Leesburg was changing, based on all of the development.\u201dCredit...Jack Fox for The New York TimesThe proposed transgender policy was not the school board\u2019s idea. It was required by a law that Virginia\u2019s Democratic governor, Ralph Northam, signed in March 2020 at the end of a whirlwind legislative session by the newly Democratic-controlled statehouse. The new law required school boards to adopt policies in line with a model policy from the State Department of Education establishing transgender students\u2019 rights. In effect, this kicked the policy debate from the state level, where Democrats held power, down to the county school boards, where conservative activists were becoming a formidable force.Dozens of those activists went to speak at the Loudoun County School Board\u2019s May 25 meeting, as did a Leesburg elementary-school physical-education teacher named Tanner Cross. \u201cI\u2019m a teacher,\u201d Cross said, \u201cbut I serve God first. And I will not affirm that a biological boy can be a girl and vice versa. Because it\u2019s against my religion. It\u2019s lying to a child. It\u2019s abuse to a child.\u201dCross\u2019s comments drew widespread attention, and he was placed on administrative leave. Over the following days, angry emails began arriving at his school, some of them coordinated by the antiracist Facebook group. Cross\u2019s \u201creluctance to show respect to a child by using their proper name and pronouns can result in their DEATH,\u201d Christina Croll, a former school-board member, wrote. \u201cTo me, that makes Mr. Cross a weapon. And weapons are not allowed in schools.\u201dOne mother wrote that her son \u201cloved\u201d the gym teacher, \u201cand as a little guy, always felt strong and good about himself under Mr. Cross\u2019s teaching.\u201d But the boy\u2019s older sibling was nonbinary, the mother explained. \u201cThey have been through a lot this year: depression, self harm,\u201d an assessment showing a risk of suicide. \u201cThis is a mental health and safety issue for both my children.\u201dWhen Cross was suspended, the county\u2019s long-smoldering tensions exploded. The Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal organization, dispatched a lawyer to represent Cross in a lawsuit against the school district. (A judge ordered him reinstated that June. He later settled with the school district, and the suspension was wiped from his record.) In a sermon, the pastor of the conservative evangelical megachurch that Cross attended accused the school board of \u201cemotionally abusing our children by perpetuating lies about gender confusion\u201d and let volunteers from Ian Prior\u2019s recall effort gather signatures at the church.\u201cWe were cooking with gasoline at this point,\u201d Prior said.Scott Ziegler, who approved Cross\u2019s suspension, watched these developments closely. He was promoted to interim superintendent in the middle of the pandemic, when many of the school controversies were already underway. \u201cI knew it would be rocky,\u201d he told me. From his seat on the dais at the school-board meetings in the spring of 2021, he watched the machinations of Ian Prior \u2014 \u201ca kind of out-of-work Trumper\u201d \u2014 and noted what seemed to be a direct pipeline from public-comment speeches to Fox News highlight reels. At the meetings, he told me, he and other administration members would quietly bet one another \u201chow many trifectas we were going to get in public comment\u201d: how many speakers would bring up Covid, critical race theory and transgender policy in their allotted 60 seconds.Ziegler, who is now 55, was a Dead Kennedys and Ramones fan in his youth and a police chaplain and, for a time, a Republican in adulthood. Over the course of his career as a teacher and then an administrator in districts across the state, he came to lean left on most social issues \u2014 and, on the issues that had lately roiled his district, he was unequivocal. \u201cI think that schools should always be welcoming for all students, regardless of gender identity, gender expression, sexuality, all of these things,\u201d he said.The bathroom incident at Stone Bridge High School happened at the precise moment that Policy 8040 became a statewide political story. Ziegler told me that when the administrators assembled for their virtual meeting on the afternoon of the assault, or in another conversation that day, he asked Tim Flynn, the Stone Bridge principal, whether the assailant was transgender.\u201cLook, the kid is not transgender,\u201d Ziegler recalled Flynn saying. \u201cHe runs with the drama crowd, and you know how the drama crowd can be. They\u2019re attention-seeking. And he\u2019s been experimenting with different looks.\u201d He wore skirts on occasion, \u201cbut he has never come out to the school as either nonbinary or transgender.\u201d (Flynn did not respond to requests for comment.)The boy\u2019s mother described her son similarly. \u201cHe had presented to me this desire to explore a different lifestyle,\u201d she said, which involved sometimes wearing women\u2019s clothes. But he was \u201cabsolutely not\u201d transgender, she said, and \u201che did not identify as fluid or anything like that.\u201d If the boy had never to anyone\u2019s knowledge identified as anything other than a boy, Ziegler reasoned, then he would not have been allowed in the girls\u2019 bathroom under Policy 8040 any more than he would have been under the existing rules.Ziegler told me that when Beth Barts asked her question about bathroom assaults at the June 22 school-board meeting, he understood it to refer to assaults by transgender students, which the board members had been discussing. \u201cThe answer to that was, and is to this day, no,\u201d he told me \u2014 a point that he made directly later in the meeting.But whatever his intentions might or might not have been, his answer was, on its face, false. And it was only a matter of time before someone noticed.The day after Scott Smith\u2019s arrest, the family posted a brief statement on the public Facebook page of their plumbing company, Plumb Crazy, referring to the \u201ctraumatic nightmare that our family, specifically our daughter has been enduring since our daughter was sexually assaulted in her High School Bathroom by another student.\u201dThe Smiths were contacted through a mutual friend by Patti Menders, the president of the Loudoun County Republican Women\u2019s Club. She arranged a video call with the couple, Ian Prior and another parents\u2019-rights activist. \u201cI was horrified,\u201d Prior later wrote. \u201cBut I was also intrigued about how this might impact Policy 8040.\u201dIn 2016 and 2017, Republican state lawmakers across the country, responding to recent court decisions and federal and local policies advancing transgender rights, had introduced 61 \u201cbathroom bills\u201d: legislation that would legally obligate people to use the public restroom of their birth gender. Many of the bills were based on a model policy drafted by the Alliance Defending Freedom, the organization that later defended Tanner Cross, which had a history of litigating against expansions in L.G.B.T.Q. rights. Advocates for the legislation often claimed that the bills weren\u2019t really about transgender rights at all, but about public safety. \u201cIt\u2019s about preventing a free pass to sexual predators, who are not transgender, to be able to walk into any bathroom with any child or any woman at any time,\u201d Dan Patrick, Texas\u2019 lieutenant governor, said at the time.The problem with this argument was that there was no evidence, from the few municipalities and school districts with transgender-friendly bathroom policies, that such policies had led to an increase in sexual assaults. When it came to the safety of transgender and nonbinary youths, the opposite was true: A Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health study found that they were more likely to report having been sexually assaulted if their bathroom and locker-room access at school was restricted. In all but one state, North Carolina, the bathroom bills failed. As Scott Ziegler put it at the June 22 school-board meeting, citing a 2016 Time magazine story, \u201cthe predator transgender student or person simply does not exist.\u201d Yet the details of Scott Smith\u2019s daughter\u2019s assault \u2014 the skirt, the bathroom \u2014 and Ziegler\u2019s denial in the meeting now seemed to potentially suggest otherwise.Although the full story wasn\u2019t yet known, Smith\u2019s arrest had already made him a sympathetic figure on the right. Across the country, conservative protests at suburban school-board meetings were regularly ending in clashes with law enforcement that were cast as evidence of either an increasingly violent and tantrum-based right-wing politics or liberals\u2019 heightened intolerance of dissent. ProPublica tallied 59 arrests, a vast majority of them white suburbanites, at school-board meetings over 18 months starting in May 2021.In most cases the charges were dropped, but in Smith\u2019s they were not. Loudoun County\u2019s elected prosecutor, Buta Biberaj, a Democrat, decided to personally prosecute Smith\u2019s case, despite the relatively minor charges of obstruction and disorderly conduct. (Biberaj told me she did so because, given the intensity of the school-board fight, there was likely to be \u201canimosity toward the attorney who tried it,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to subject our attorneys to that.\u201d) Smith was convicted and received a suspended sentence. He is appealing his conviction. The judge, a Republican who served as the county\u2019s prosecutor before Biberaj, has since ordered her removed from the case, citing \u201cconcerns about public confidence in the integrity of the prosecution.\u201dOn Aug. 11, as the school board met and passed Policy 8040, parents\u2019-rights activists held a rally outside the administration building. One of the speakers was Dick Black, the Republican former state senator who, at the chaotic June meeting, claimed that board members were forcing schoolchildren to lie about gender. Now the winds of an approaching thunderstorm rippled a \u201cProtect Every Kid\u201d banner as Black denounced the board. \u201cThey\u2019re scared of the public!\u201d he shouted. \u201cThey\u2019re scared of the voters!\u201dThen Black told the full story of Scott Smith\u2019s arrest at the last meeting, the first time anyone had done so publicly, though he didn\u2019t name him. \u201cHis daughter, at Stone Bridge High School, had one of these guys wearing a girl\u2019s dress go into the girls\u2019 bathroom and forcibly sodomize her,\u201d Black said. The crowd erupted into boos. \u201cThat was the man who was arrested!\u201dA week and a half after Scott Smith\u2019s arrest, the county sheriff\u2019s office had finally filed felony sexual-assault charges against the boy, and he was taken into custody in early July. A notification of the charges against him \u2014 the only formal notification the school district was to receive \u2014 was sent to the district that month, but it was addressed to an employee who no longer worked in the central administration and, according to officials, was misplaced in the interoffice mail.The boy\u2019s mother was attending a juvenile-court hearing in August when she realized that nobody in the district had yet contacted her with a plan for where her son was to be placed the coming school year, since he was not allowed to return to Stone Bridge. She reached out to an administrator who initiated a transfer to another school in Ashburn, Broad Run High School. Then she arranged a meeting with David Spage, the school\u2019s principal, and other school administrators. \u201cThey were made aware of the charges,\u201d she recalled. Still, the boy was enrolled in regular classroom instruction. (Spage declined to comment.)Soon after the boy started at Broad Run, reports began arriving in Spage\u2019s office. An art teacher who had the boy in her class reported that two female students had complained that he was following them around and asked to be seated away from him in class. In an English class, the boy made sexual comments to a girl, grabbed her roughly by the shoulder and asked if she had posted any nude photos online. The only disciplinary measure the school took was asking the boy to write a brief statement. \u201cI will not touch others,\u201d he wrote on a sheet of notebook paper. \u201cI will not ask for photos.\u201dOn the afternoon of Oct. 6, the boy\u2019s mother was at work when she received a voice mail message from Corinne Czekaj, the detective from the sheriff\u2019s office who was investigating the May bathroom assault. Czekaj said she was at Broad Run.\u201cI need you to give me a call,\u201d she said.ImageIan Prior, a Republican political consultant, started a parents\u2019-rights organization called Fight for Schools and organized a school-board recall effort.Credit...Matt Eich for The New York TimesThe second assault victim was also a girl the boy knew. He had asked her to walk with him between classes, and she agreed. Video footage from the school\u2019s security cameras captured him putting his arm around the girl\u2019s neck and pulling her into an empty classroom. There, he held her in a chokehold and groped her.On Oct. 7, the sheriff\u2019s office put out a brief statement. Within hours, the assailant\u2019s identity had circulated among the district\u2019s parents, including Ian Prior. Prior called Luke Rosiak, a reporter for The Daily Wire. \u201cDude,\u201d Prior recalled telling him, \u201cthis is the same kid.\u201dA conservative media company co-founded by the pundit Ben Shapiro, The Daily Wire had become particularly dedicated to hostile coverage of \u201cgender ideology\u201d and was home to prominent right-wing commentators who were frank about their aim to, as the contributor Michael Knowles later put it, \u201ceradicate transgenderism from public life.\u201d In September, with the assistance of the county Republican Women\u2019s Club president, Patti Menders, the Daily Wire commentator Matt Walsh attended a Loudoun County school-board meeting and spoke during the public-comment period. \u201cYou are all child abusers,\u201d he told them. \u201cYou prey upon impressionable children and indoctrinate them into your insane ideological cult.\u201d A video that Walsh posted of his remarks received more than 10 million views on YouTube.Rosiak was more of a reporter than a polemicist, and for a year he had been perhaps the most dogged chronicler of the dramas and outrages around the Loudoun County schools, a favorite journalist contact among local activists. He had been talking to Scott Smith for months. In the article he published that week, the disparate outrages of Loudoun County became a single story culminating in the second assault, all the pieces snapping into place with an almost audible click. Smith had wanted justice for his daughter \u2014 and, for his efforts, had been persecuted and humiliated at every turn by Loudoun County\u2019s liberal school administrators, working hand in glove with local Democratic elected officials.Noting that the school board was in the middle of trying to pass Policy 8040, Rosiak pointed to the significance of the meeting exchange between Barts and Ziegler in which Ziegler denied knowledge of any assaults in school bathrooms. \u201cA school policy passed following what appear to be false statements from the superintendent \u2014 a policy whose passage would have been politically impossible had Smith\u2019s story seen the light of day,\u201d Rosiak wrote.Appearing on \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\u201d on Fox News that evening, he went further. \u201cIt raises the possibility,\u201d he said, \u201cthat the Loudoun County Public Schools covered up the rape of a 14-year-old girl at the hands of a boy wearing a skirt in order to pass a school policy that Democrats were adamant about passing \u2014 and as a result of concealing that, a second girl was raped last week.\u201dThere had been no second rape \u2014 the second sexual assault, though it was never fully described by law enforcement, was charged as a misdemeanor \u2014 but by now, the story was fast slipping loose of the evidence at hand. \u201cA ninth-grade girl, 14, reportedly sexually assaulted in a bathroom by a self-described transgender student wearing a skirt,\u201d Carlson told his audience. (The girl\u2019s age was stated incorrectly repeatedly.) Laura Ingraham told hers: \u201cThe rights of transgender students being put over the rights of regular folks.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve heard you sick, disgusting pigs are fine with hiding the sexual assault of a young girl by a trans boy,\u201d read one of many death threats the school-board members received. \u201cYou people need to be arrested, tried and then hung by the neck until you\u2019re dead for hiding this.\u201dVirginia was in the midst of its governor\u2019s race, and the Republican candidate, Glenn Youngkin, had embraced the parents\u2019-rights movement \u2014 and embraced its stand in Loudoun County. After the suspension of Tanner Cross, the gym teacher, he went on Fox News to demand his reinstatement. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing right here, right now in Loudoun County, is the liberal left waging a culture war, and the victims are our children,\u201d Youngkin said. In June, he held a rally outside the Loudoun County schools\u2019 administrative building in Ashburn.His opponent, the former Democratic governor Terry McAuliffe, had paid little heed to the schools issue. When the subject came up onstage at the candidates\u2019 final debate that fall, McAuliffe said, \u201cI don\u2019t think parents should be telling schools what they should teach.\u201d By the early hours of the following morning, it was the main Fox News headline from the debate.That day, the National School Boards Association sent a letter to President Biden warning that \u201cAmerica\u2019s public schools and its education leaders are under an imminent threat,\u201d citing months of disruption, threats and violence directed at school boards and administrators. It called on the federal government to \u201cinvestigate, intercept and prevent the current threats and acts of violence.\u201d Its litany of school-board-meeting unrest included Scott Smith\u2019s arrest in Loudoun County. The association\u2019s board, under heavy criticism from parents\u2019-rights groups and Republican attorneys general, would apologize for the letter, but not before Attorney General Merrick Garland directed the F.B.I. to discuss \u201cstrategies\u201d for addressing such threats with local authorities.In his campaign speeches, Youngkin connected the dots. \u201cFor months, we\u2019ve seen chaos seep into our schools,\u201d he said at a rally in late October. \u201cA new instance each week until the unthinkable happened: Virginia \u2014 and America \u2014 awoke to the news that a young teenage girl had been sexually assaulted in her Loudoun County school. And worse, the school administrators covered it up, and Loudoun\u2019s commonwealth attorney targeted the victim\u2019s family.\u201dOn Nov. 2, Youngkin, who had been trailing significantly in late-September polls, beat McAuliffe by two points. Within hours, Loudoun County \u2014 which McAuliffe won, but by 10 points less than Northam had in 2017 \u2014 went from scandal to strategy. The day after the election, Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leader, announced plans to introduce legislation establishing a \u201cParent\u2019s Bill of Rights.\u201d (It passed the House quickly but was never voted on in the Senate.) \u201cWe watched parents come to school-board meetings, craving to have input \u2014 a father getting arrested when his daughter was molested in a bathroom,\u201d McCarthy told reporters.This year, Ian Prior published a book titled \u201cParents of the World, Unite! How to Save Our Schools From the Left\u2019s Radical Agenda,\u201d which he billed as a sort of \u201cArt of War\u201d for parents\u2019-rights activists. In Loudoun County, he believed, parents\u2019-rights activists had done something rarer than succeeding at politics. They had succeeded in creating the conditions of politics. \u201cIt\u2019s like we built this wave,\u201d Prior told me. \u201cAnd he\u201d \u2014 Youngkin \u2014 \u201cdid a good job of getting on the surfboard and riding the wave.\u201dThe political afterlife of the assaults was impossible to separate from the factual void that lay at the heart of the scandal. The ages of the assailant and both victims had kept the Loudoun County school district and sheriff\u2019s office from releasing more than the bare minimum of information about either case. The families involved had remained silent and unidentified, with one exception: Scott and Jessica Smith. Their account had been the backbone of the Daily Wire story, and Scott Smith, who had tried unsuccessfully to land an interview with Tucker Carlson after his daughter\u2019s assault and again after his arrest, was suddenly an in-demand presence on Fox News\u2019s prime-time lineup.\u201cIf we didn\u2019t do this \u2014 stand up \u2014 no one would know what happened in Loudoun County,\u201d Smith told me. He wasn\u2019t wrong; in the absence of other sources, his story stood for more than a year as the story. He was the apparent sole source, for instance, of a key detail that had made the story incendiary in the first place: the claim that the boy who assaulted his daughter identified as gender fluid.But on this score, Smith\u2019s account had changed. At first, in the Daily Wire story, he told Rosiak: \u201cThe person that attacked our daughter is apparently bisexual and occasionally wears dresses because he likes them.\u201d He went on: \u201cSo this kid is technically not what the school board was fighting about.\u201d Within days, though, he said in a statement to the news media through his attorney: \u201cThe facts are that a male student claiming to be \u2018gender fluid\u2019 was permitted to enter the girls\u2019 bathroom on May 28 and sexually assault our daughter.\u201dWhen I asked Smith how he knew any of this, he replied, \u201cI didn\u2019t really know at first, to be honest.\u201d He said that evidence he saw much later during the investigation the school district conducted after the second assault, including a law-enforcement interview with the assailant, made clear that the boy identified as \u201cpansexual.\u201d (The boy\u2019s mother told me she did not know where the description of her son as pansexual originated.) \u201cI don\u2019t really understand \u2018pansexual,\u2019 exactly,\u201d Smith conceded. There was nothing in the evidence he had seen, he said, that gave him \u201cany reason to believe that he wanted to necessarily have a sex change. I think he\u2019s just a sexual deviant, you know, expressing his \u2014 I mean, I don\u2019t know.\u201dPansexuality, or attraction toward people regardless of their sexual or gender identity, is categorically different from gender fluidity. It is a sexual orientation, not a gender identity, and so a self-identified pansexual would not have been allowed into the girls\u2019 bathroom under Policy 8040 \u2014 as Smith himself seemed to recognize in the Daily Wire interview.Confusion on this point would persist in commentary on the case, some of it no doubt willful. But it also reflected the vast gulf between the vanguard of the discourse on gender and sexuality, which increasingly shaped school policies, and the popular awareness of it. Ziegler and other administrators and school-board members spoke fluently of \u201cgender identity\u201d and \u201cgender expression.\u201d But how many of the parents in the district could have defined the difference between the terms?In late October, Smith\u2019s daughter testified in the juvenile trial of her assailant. To the displeasure of the parents of both the accused boy and the victim, the judge made the unusual decision to open the trial to a handful of reporters \u2014 an indication of the sheer volume of media attention that now surrounded it.The trial was the first time any of the three teenagers at the heart of the scandal spoke publicly about it. In court, the story the girl told was, if not wholly different from her father\u2019s, more complicated. She had been involved with the boy, she said, and on May 28, they went to the bathroom together. It was only once they were in the stall together that the encounter turned nonconsensual.It was, in her telling, clearly a sexual assault. But in the published accounts of the trial, no one who testified described the boy claiming to be anything in order to enter the bathroom, or suggested that he had required any artifice to do so. He was found guilty of two counts of forcible sodomy in the first incident and pleaded no contest to felony abduction and misdemeanor sexual battery in the second. (The boy did not testify in the trial, nor did the victim in the second assault.) He was sent to a residential treatment program.The juvenile trial knocked down one of the central claims of the narrative of the scandal, but it did not address the other: that the school administrators had been sufficiently concerned about the question of the boy\u2019s gender that they had buried the assault, perhaps in collusion with the school board. The Barts-Ziegler exchange about bathroom assaults remained, to the parents\u2019-rights activists and their political allies, a clear indication of a cover-up.Jason Miyares, the Republican candidate for attorney general in that fall\u2019s election, had, like Youngkin, leaned into the Loudoun County outrage during his campaign and built relationships with the local parents\u2019-rights activists\u2019 over the summer. In July, he spoke at a fund-raiser for Prior\u2019s group, Fight for Schools. After winning his race in November, he hired as his community liaison Patti Menders, the Loudoun County Republican Women\u2019s Club president who had arranged the call between the Smiths and Ian Prior.At a news conference two days after the election, a reporter asked Miyares: \u201cDo you plan to investigate Loudoun County Public Schools, and the recent sexual assaults that have happened there?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Miyares replied.ImageScott Ziegler was fired as Loudoun County Public Schools\u2019 superintendent in December, after a special grand jury investigation.Credit...Matt Eich for The New York Times\u201cWhat we saw was a school board that went woke, and I like to say, once you go woke, you go broke,\u201d Miyares told Sean Hannity in January 2022, shortly after Youngkin signed an executive order authorizing a state investigation. \u201cThey\u2019ve played politics with our children\u2019s safety. And they passed a policy, and obviously, as you noted, there was a tragic violent sexual assault that happened.\u201dMiyares asked for a special grand jury to be impaneled that March. But when the special grand jury\u2019s report was unsealed in December, the direct line from politics to tragedy that he had promised was nowhere to be found. The second assault \u201ccould have, and should have, been prevented,\u201d the report argued, but it concluded that \u201cthere was not a coordinated cover-up\u201d between administrators and school-board members.Out of more than 100 pieces of evidence the special grand jury reviewed from the school district and the school board, the report presented only one suggesting that Policy 8040 might have factored into the handling of the case: the email from Kevin Lewis, the district\u2019s chief operations officer, calling the virtual meeting on the afternoon of the first assault, in which he said the incident was related to the pending policy.According to the report, both the school administration and the school board seemed to have done their best to conceal that email from the investigators. In their sworn testimony, administrators who attended the virtual meeting claimed to have forgotten anything of consequence that was said on the call. \u201cWe believe,\u201d the report concluded bluntly, that \u201cthere was intentional institutional amnesia regarding this meeting.\u201dThis was the crux of the case: Depending on one\u2019s politics, the administrators\u2019 behavior was a validation of the parents\u2019-rights activists\u2019 allegations, or run-of-the-mill bureaucratic defensiveness, or justifiable outmaneuvering of an inquiry that the school officials, by that point, had cause to view as a partisan fishing expedition. That all of these things looked the same from the outside explained much of how the politics of the county\u2019s schools had grown so poisonous.Shortly after the report\u2019s release, Smith and Prior appeared together on Laura Ingraham\u2019s Fox News show, \u201cThe Ingraham Angle.\u201d Smith seemed deflated by the report, which \u201cpretty much told us what we already knew,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody held accountable by name.\u201dPrior was more sanguine. \u201cI suspect we could see more down the road in the very near future,\u201d he said. Sure enough, the following week, Miyares\u2019s office unsealed three indictments against Scott Ziegler, the superintendent.While the grand-jury report found no evidence of conspiracy, it presented an unsparing picture of the administration\u2019s handling of the assaults. In both the first and, more inexplicable, the second case, warnings clearly raised by teachers had gone unheeded by the district administration, which had been \u201cseverely delinquent with its Title IX responsibilities,\u201d the report argued, referring to the federal law that prevents sex-based discrimination in schools that receive federal funding. In short, the district had failed to protect the girls in its care. (District officials have said they were waiting for the sheriff\u2019s office to complete its investigation before beginning Title IX proceedings.) By the time Ziegler\u2019s indictments were unsealed, he had already been fired by the school board.Still, Ziegler\u2019s supporters and detractors both regarded the charges he faced as a tacit admission of defeat by the attorney general. All three were minor misdemeanors, and only one actually had to do with the sexual-assault cases: He was charged with \u201cfalse publication\u201d for his statement at the June 22 school-board meeting denying that any assaults had occurred in school bathrooms, an obscure offense that carried a maximum penalty of a $500 fine. (The grand jury indicted Wayde Byard, the school district\u2019s spokesman, on a more serious felony charge of perjury, stemming from his testimony, but he was acquitted in June.)\u201cI\u2019m not saying I\u2019m not happy the grand jury came up with something \u2014 it is something,\u201d Scott Smith told me.\u201cBut there\u2019s so much more,\u201d Jessica Smith said. The Smiths say they plan to pursue a Title IX lawsuit against the district. Separately, the U.S. Department of Education opened a Title IX investigation into the district this spring. It was prompted by a complaint filed by Prior on behalf of the America First Legal Foundation, the former Trump adviser Stephen Miller\u2019s organization.Ziegler\u2019s trial will begin this month. The Smiths\u2019 daughter, who turns 18 this fall, plans to testify as a witness for the state. Doing so, the family knew, was likely to tear away what little privacy and anonymity she still maintained, but, Smith insisted, \u201cshe wants to talk.\u201dIn April, I went to the Loudoun County Courthouse for a preliminary hearing in the case. Ziegler sat in a middle row of the courtroom, wearing small hoop earrings and black nail polish \u2014 flourishes that would later draw an irate headline from The Daily Wire. \u201cI wore a suit and tie for years,\u201d he told me, but \u201cit was never my style.\u201d Now that he was retired, \u201cI can do what I want,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd,\u201d he added with a smile, \u201cit pisses people off.\u201dThe Smiths sat across the aisle from Ziegler, neither party acknowledging the other. But as everyone waited for the judge to arrive, I was surprised to see the Smiths chatting amiably with Beth Barts \u2014 the great villain, besides Ziegler, of the parents\u2019-rights crusade in Loudoun County.Under pressure from the Fight for Schools recall campaign and, she told me, disgust at what she saw as her colleagues\u2019 lack of concern over the second assault, Barts had resigned her post days after news of that assault broke. She seemed to be reconsidering, if not her politics, at least their fervency. She was now on cordial terms with Prior and, in the upcoming race for her old school-board seat, she told me, she was supporting a nonpartisan candidate who was challenging the Democratic incumbent who succeeded her.Barts was not the only one who seemed to be rethinking political alliances. \u201cI\u2019ve turned on Youngkin,\u201d Scott Smith told me in July. He said that he appreciated the governor\u2019s support of parents\u2019 rights but was bothered that he had not heard from the governor since the election. The same was true of Miyares, he said.\u201cPeople say, \u2018The right used you,\u2019\u201d Smith went on. \u201cI look at it more like a drunk one-night stand: I got what I wanted; they got what they wanted. Youngkin got elected. I got a special grand jury.\u201dImageLoudoun County, Va., viewed across the Potomac River from Point of Rocks, Md.Credit...Matt Eich for The New York TimesLast September, Youngkin\u2019s Department of Education released a draft model policy for transgender students, reversing the provisions that sparked most of the conservative backlash in Loudoun County and elsewhere. Under the new rules, formalized this summer, students are allowed to use only the bathrooms or locker rooms associated with their birth sex and must file legal documents to change their pronouns. Teachers have to notify parents of any mental-health discussions with their children at school. \u201cParents must have a role in their children\u2019s lives, and as these important decisions are made, parents must be informed and included,\u201d Youngkin told reporters in Leesburg that week.Students at schools across the state walked out of class in protest, including nearly 1,400 students at Loudoun County high schools. \u201cIt felt like a big step in getting students to realize their potential to speak out,\u201d said Caroline Northedge, at the time a high-school senior, who helped organize the protest in Loudoun County. \u201cIn Loudoun, the emphasis that was put on empowering parents was really frustrating,\u201d she said. \u201cThe voices heard, the questions asked.\u201dIan Prior now works with America First Legal, which in the 2022 election cycle spent millions of dollars in advertising and advocacy aimed at rolling back transgender rights. Since 2021, at least eight states have signed into law bills restricting bathroom use. I asked Prior why these bills succeeded when similar legislation had so resoundingly failed not even a decade ago. The stridency of transgender-rights advocates had probably hurt them, he thought. But he also thought the schools themselves had invited a backlash simply through the newly constant presence of gender in the classroom, as a subject of teaching materials and policies and paperwork. \u201cIt\u2019s just not something they thought about until they started paying attention to what was being taught,\u201d he said, \u201cand how it was being taught.\u201dHis theory is supported by public-opinion research, which in recent years has consistently shown a turn against transgender-friendly policies in bathrooms, sports and other areas. Last fall, a Public Religion Research Institute survey found an 18-point shift in favor of restrictive bathroom policies among political independents since 2016, and a 17-point shift among all Americans. This no doubt owed something to advocacy campaigns like America First Legal\u2019s. But it also suggested a chronic problem of liberal social activism, which invests great energy in demanding that people think more about race, gender and sexuality but cannot control how they think about it.Still, there was reason to be skeptical that this was quite the parents\u2019 revolution that Prior and others claimed. Opposition to transgender rights has become a core tenet of the right\u2019s own identity politics. The Public Religion Research Institute survey found that while independents have soured significantly on transgender policies, the largest swing by far has been among Republicans. A minority of 44 percent supported bathroom restrictions in 2016. By last fall, 74 percent did.There is good cause to think that Youngkin\u2019s victory, too, had more to do with the passions of the base than the alienation of suburban parents. An analysis by the Virginia Public Access Project, mapping the surge in turnout in 2021 relative to the last governor\u2019s election, found that the percentage increase was generally higher in rural, heavily Republican counties than in the big suburban counties that took center stage in the school fights. In other words, if the high-profile conflicts over suburban school districts like Loudoun County had driven the surge in interest in the election, that surge was most pronounced among voters who did not have children in those schools.In another postelection study, TargetSmart, a Democratic data firm, matched Virginia\u2019s 2021 election data to individual voters\u2019 demographic information. The surge in turnout among voters ages 50 and older accounted for two and a half times as many new ballots as the increase among voters between ages 30 and 49, who were more likely to have children in school. When Fight for Schools was first canvassing for its recall effort, \u201cthere were a lot of people we talked to who said, \u2018I don\u2019t have kids in the school, but I have grandkids,\u2019\u201d Prior told me. \u201cThey were the easiest ones to get to sign petitions.\u201dIn this sense, what happened in Loudoun County was not such a new or unusual story. Political scientists have observed a growing disconnect between who has a direct stake in schools and who votes in the elections that shape them. School-board-election voters tend to be older than parents of school-age children. They are also overwhelmingly white, even as students of color have come to outnumber white students nationally.\u201cSometimes their interests are aligned with the kids\u2019,\u201d said Vladimir Kogan, a political scientist at Ohio State University who studies school-district politics. \u201cSometimes they\u2019re not.\u201d The combatants in those battles \u2014 waged by the left and the right over mascots and textbooks, sports teams and bathrooms \u2014 were often sincere in their intentions, Kogan was quick to point out. \u201cThey are convinced that what they\u2019re doing is really good for kids,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are really complicated political issues, on which reasonable people can disagree.\u201d But, he said, those fights did implicitly raise a question: \u201cDo we care about learning, or do we care about these symbolic issues that get voters fired up?\u201dThis was more of a zero-sum question than the combatants might wish to admit. A meeting that a school board spent debating a problematic mascot was a meeting that it did not spend on a new learning technology program. A million-dollar settlement over a textbook lawsuit was a million dollars not going to classroom instruction. The school board seats lost, superintendents fired or driven out, exhausted teacher retirements \u2014 all of that churn came at a cost, too. \u201cI think a lot of the time,\u201d Kogan said, \u201cadult actors want to wish away those trade-offs.\u201dLast year, Kogan released the early results of a study trying to quantify what students might have lost in those trade-offs. Looking at more than 500 school districts that weathered local culture-war conflicts between 2010 and 2018, he found a small but statistically robust decline in student math scores compared with districts that had not. Although his data were drawn from earlier controversies, he called the phenomenon the \u201cLoudoun County effect\u201d \u2014 a nod to the most recent cautionary tale.\u201cWell-intentioned advocacy,\u201d he said, \u201csometimes has unintended consequences.\u201dMatt Eich is a photographer in Virginia working on long-form projects related to memory, family, community and America.

I came down with Covid for the second time last week, and it left me shivering, sweating, panting a little, unable to sleep, unable to get out of bed. I watched things on my screens. I drank a lot of Gatorade and swallowed my dose of Paxlovid in the mornings and at night. I ate little. I kept panic about my breathlessness at bay. It was not a good time.I thought a lot about what I was going to cook, and eat, once I got better. These were spacey fever dreams. High on the list: Bryan Washington\u2019s new recipe for chilaquiles verdes (above), which he wrote about for The New York Times Magazine.What I love about the recipe, and about Bryan\u2019s cooking in general, is his understanding of how recipes aren\u2019t rules so much as guideposts, ways of thinking about dishes that can mutate over time, perhaps because of circumstance or taste. There are a thousand ways to make chilaquiles, after all, and in Bryan\u2019s view, the best way is the way the dish was prepared the last time he ate it. \u201cLike so much of cooking\u2019s calculus,\u201d he said, \u201cchilaquiles are as much about feel as about measurements and instructions.\u201d______Featured RecipeChilaquiles VerdesView Recipe \u2192______So attend to his recipe, and make it your own. Excellent tortillas help, as does time spent making the salsa verde with care. But I\u2019ll tell you what: You could make chilaquiles with store-bought tortilla chips and a jar of your favorite salsa verde (mine\u2019s from Herdez) and feel a wonderment, especially if you\u2019ve been laid low and are just trying to find a sense of the delicious.Then keep it up. I\u2019d like to make our recipe for the best chicken salad this weekend, for lunches next week, and kimchi carbonara for Saturday night, if not clam fritters and coleslaw. Some have asked if they can use canned chopped clams for those fritters. You can, but before you do, see if your fishmonger has frozen chopped clams \u2014 the true middle ground between fresh and preserved.And grilled chicken with tomatoes and corn for dinner on Sunday night? I\u2019d like that, though if I\u2019ve got the energy (I\u2019m still a little shaky!), I\u2019d almost prefer a celery Victor salad, with cold slices of watermelon for dessert.There are many thousands more recipes to cook this weekend, waiting for you on New York Times Cooking, at least if you have a subscription. Subscriptions support our work and make it possible to continue. I hope if you haven\u2019t taken one out already, that you will subscribe today. Thank you.If you run into problems with our technology, please reach out for help: cookingcare@NYTimes.com. Someone will get back to you. Or if you\u2019d like to lodge a complaint or offer a compliment to one of our hard-working staff members, you can write to me: foodeditor@NYTimes.com. I can\u2019t respond to every letter. I get a lot of them. But I do read every one I receive.Now, it has nothing to do with beurre blanc or ripe blackberries, but after I rewatched Michael Mann\u2019s 1995 thriller, \u201cHeat,\u201d with a 103-degree fever, his novel \u201cHeat 2\u201d made a lot more sense to me. (I caught the film on Netflix; it\u2019s on other streaming services as well.)Are you caught up on Steven Soderbergh\u2019s \u201cFull Circle\u201d on Max? Y\u2019oughta get on that. It took me down a Soderbergh rabbit hole to his excellent \u201cCommand Z,\u201d written with Kurt Andersen, on their very own website.Finally, here\u2019s my anthem this week, the song that kept me going: \u201cStill Getting It Done,\u201d from Ghost of Vroom. I\u2019ll see you on Sunday.Read MoreEggplant ParmesanEric Kim1 hour 35 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.Soy-Glazed Salmon Hand RollsKay Chun30 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easySheet-Pan Chicken Thighs With Spicy CornMelissa Clark55 minutes, plus at least 30 minutes\u2019 marinatingSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyBlistered Broccoli Pasta With Walnuts, Pecorino and MintDawn Perry15 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyTomato Cheddar ToastsAli Slagle10 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.Pork Ribs AdoboJulia Moskin, Amy Besa, Romy Dorotan1 hour 30 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyChilled Zucchini Soup With Lemon and BasilHetty Lui McKinnon15 minutes, plus optional chillingSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyPeach CrispYossy ArefiAbout 2 hoursSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyChilaquiles VerdesBryan Washington20 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.Best Chicken SaladJulia Moskin20 minutes, plus 2 hours' resting and 4 hours' chillingSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.Kimchi CarbonaraElyse Inamine, Melanie Hye Jin Meyer25 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyColeslawKay Chun10 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyCoconut-Dill Salmon With Green Beans and CornYewande Komolafe40 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyGrilled Pork Chops With Plum BBQ SauceEric Kim30 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyBaked Feta Dip With Spicy Tomatoes and HoneyMelissa Clark1 hour 20 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.Nonalcoholic Dirty Lemon TonicRebekah Peppler5 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.Moka Dupont: A French Icebox CakeDorie Greenspan30 minutes, plus at least 3 hours chillingSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyOvernight OatsGenevieve Ko5 minutes, plus overnight soakingSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.Slow Cooker Chipotle-Honey Chicken TacosSarah DiGregorio3 to 5 hoursSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.healthyThai-Style Crunchy Vegetable SaladKay Chun20 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.See all recipes Recipes We Think You\u2019ll LoveDishes recommended for you based on what you\u2019ve savedTrending RecipesMore From Our EditorsWeeknight dinners, seasonal favorites and other ideas for this week.Summer Tomato RecipesTomato BruschettaAli Slagle15 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easySheet-Pan Baked Feta With Broccolini, Tomatoes and LemonYasmin Fahr25 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyBasil and Tomato Fried RiceHetty Lui McKinnon15 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyDumpling Tomato Salad With Chile Crisp VinaigretteHetty Lui McKinnon20 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easySesame Tomato SaladKay Chun20 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyHot Dogs With Pico de GalloGenevieve Ko, Tanya Sichynsky30 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyJuicy Tomatoes With Parmesan-Olive Bread CrumbsChristian Reynoso40 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyClassic Caprese SaladMelissa Clark15 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyBest GazpachoJulia Moskin20 minutes plus chilling timeSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.Cold Tofu Salad With Tomatoes and PeachesHana Asbrink20 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyMarinated Mozzarella, Olives and Cherry TomatoesDavid Tanis20 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyGrilled Chicken With Tomatoes and CornAli Slagle30 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyTuna and Tomato SaladAli Slagle20 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyPuttanesca Chickpea-Tomato SaladAli Slagle15 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.Kachumbari (Tomato and Onion Relish)Kayla Stewart, Michael W.

In addition to the United States and European countries, notable attendees included China, India, Brazil, South Africa and some of the oil-rich Gulf nations that have tried to maintain good relations with both Ukraine and Russia throughout the war, which began in February 2022.Many of the countries that have declared their neutrality appear unlikely to shift their stances, though, and some reject the very concept of choosing sides, framing the war as a contest between superpowers that they want no part in.\u201cThis is not only a conflict between Russia and Ukraine,\u201d Celso Amorim, international affairs adviser to President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva of Brazil, said in a speech that he delivered virtually during the talks. \u201cThis is also a chapter in the longstanding rivalry between Russia and the West,\u201d he said, according to a copy of the speech obtained by The New York Times.The gathering was closed to media, which a Saudi state television correspondent broadcasting from outside the venue attributed to the talks\u2019 \u201csensitivity.\u201d It underscored the tightrope that Saudi Arabia and many other countries are trying to walk to avoid alienating Moscow \u2014 and the challenges that Ukraine will face as it tries to win them over.The meeting is the starting point of what is expected to be a major Ukrainian diplomatic push in the coming months to try to undercut Russia. That began on Wednesday, when President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine recalled his ambassadors for an emergency strategy session on how to get the country\u2019s message out to the world.He told the ambassadors they must use every tool at their disposal \u2014 \u201cofficial and unofficial, institutional and media, cultural diplomacy and the power of ordinary human sincerity\u201d \u2014 to convince both steadfast allies and nations that have largely stayed neutral that the only road to a lasting peace is complete Russian defeat.ImageA Ukrainian artillery unit preparing to fire toward a target last month in Bakhmut, Ukraine.Credit...Finbarr O\u2019Reilly for The New York TimesThe annual United Nations General Assembly session in September will offer another opportunity for Ukraine to make its case. And the country is also planning a summit later in the fall to shore up backing for its 10-point peace formula in the hopes that it will form the backbone of any future settlement.Ukrainian and Western officials tried to temper expectations for the talks this weekend, stressing that they are not likely to bring the war any closer to an end; Russia is not participating.For Ukraine, the gathering comes at a pivotal moment.As furious battles raged across the front lines of Europe\u2019s bloodiest war in decades, Mr. Zelensky told his diplomats on Wednesday that things would grow even more difficult as pressure was likely to build in the coming months to find a negotiated path to peace.The choice of Saudi Arabia as host was no accident, senior Ukrainian officials said, noting the efforts that Kyiv has made to court the kingdom, the world\u2019s largest oil exporter. Like many countries in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia has toed a careful line in the war, giving financial aid to Ukraine even while cultivating close ties to Russia.Last year, the kingdom irritated the White House with a decision to cut oil production in coordination with OPEC Plus \u2014 an energy exporters\u2019 group in which Russia is a key member. The production cut helped stave off a decline in oil prices at a time when the United States was trying to undercut Russian oil revenue.ImagePrince Faisal bin Farhan, left, Saudi Arabia\u2019s foreign minister, with his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, right, and Andriy Yermak, the head of the office of the president of Ukraine, in February in Kyiv, Ukraine\u2019s capital.Credit...Pool photo by Genya SavilovChina has also declared its neutrality, despite providing Russia with vital support that has helped cushion the effects of economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation. Yet after shunning a similar gathering in June in Copenhagen, China attended the Saudi meeting, which may reflect its deepening ties with the host country. Alicja Bachulska, a fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations who studies Chinese foreign policy, said that China\u2019s participation does not mean it is changing its position on the war. But it could help burnish a carefully cultivated effort to look like a responsible and neutral actor, she said.\u201cSimply put,\u201d Ms. Bachulska said, \u201cit seems like a win-win scenario for Beijing.\u201dIndia, which sent its powerful national security adviser, Ajit Doval, to the talks, often cites its long history of nonalignment to explain its neutral position in the war today.But like many of the nations attending, India has also benefited from that stance. By maintaining its trade links with Russia, some of its biggest companies have profited handsomely from the purchase, refining and resale of Russian oil, reducing pressure on the rupee.\u201cWe have accepted the refrain that Ukraine\u2019s narrative has won over Russia, but that is mainly true in the liberal free world,\u201d said Anna Borshchevskaya, a scholar at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy who focuses on Russia in the Middle East. \u201cOutside it, the Russian narrative resonates.\u201dFor Saudi Arabia, which has long served as a mediator in regional conflicts, the gathering in Jeddah is notable because the kingdom is involving itself prominently in a crisis of the highest global priority.The de facto Saudi ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, invited Mr. Zelensky to speak in May in Jeddah at a gathering of Arab states, where the Ukrainian leader urged Middle Eastern rulers to stand with his country against Russia.For Prince Mohammed, 38, the talks offered another chance to try to position himself as a world leader with influence far beyond his region and as a mediator who can bring powerful nations to the table, even as he struggles to end his own country\u2019s involvement in a devastating war in Yemen.\u201cHosting the Ukraine peace talks gives us a taste of Saudi Arabia\u2019s reinvigorated self,\u201d said Bader Al-Saif, an assistant professor of history at Kuwait University.ImageA residential building that was hit by shelling in June in Kryvyi Rih, Ukraine. Credit...Mauricio Lima for The New York TimesUkraine faces a dual challenge as it embarks on its diplomatic push.It needs to keep the support of Western allies firm as it engages in a grueling, bloody and costly counteroffensive that, over the past two months, has yielded some gains but has yet to achieve a major breakthrough. But it also needs to broaden that support by pulling in other countries that have remained noncommittal.That will not be easy, partly because Ukraine and its Western backers are engaged in an intense struggle with Russia to win them over.President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia recently hosted a group of African leaders in his country, offering to provide free grain supplies for a half-dozen African nations. Russia has blockaded Ukrainian grain \u2014 which accounted for 10 percent of the global supply before the war \u2014 and critics have accused Moscow of using hunger as both a weapon and means to bankroll the war.Saudi Arabia must tread carefully as it wades into Ukrainian diplomacy, analysts said. While Russia and Saudi Arabia have long acted in accord on key oil-related issues in ways that were mutually beneficial, there are signs that their longstanding relationship might be under strain, as Russia appears to have pumped more oil recently than it had pledged to.ImagePatrons and staff at a Russian restaurant and nightclub in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

Trump and his associates to overturn the 2020 election.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesBy Charlie SavageReporting from WashingtonPublished Aug. 4, 2023Updated Aug. 5, 2023, 9:23 a.m. ETIn accusing former President Donald J. Trump of conspiring to subvert American democracy, the special counsel, Jack Smith, charged the same story three different ways. The charges are novel applications of criminal laws to unprecedented circumstances, heightening legal risks, but Mr. Smith\u2019s tactic gives him multiple paths in obtaining and upholding a guilty verdict.\u201cEspecially in a case like this, you want to have multiple charges that are applicable or provable with the same evidence, so that if on appeal you lose one, you still have the conviction,\u201d said Julie O\u2019Sullivan, a Georgetown University law professor and former federal prosecutor.That structure in the indictment is only one of several strategic choices by Mr. Smith \u2014 including what facts and potential charges he chose to include or omit \u2014 that may foreshadow and shape how an eventual trial of Mr. Trump will play out.The four charges rely on three criminal statutes: a count of conspiring to defraud the government, another of conspiring to disenfranchise voters, and two counts related to corruptly obstructing a congressional proceeding. Applying each to Mr. Trump\u2019s actions raises various complexities, according to a range of criminal law experts.At the same time, the indictment hints at how Mr. Smith is trying to sidestep legal pitfalls and potential defenses. He began with an unusual preamble that reads like an opening statement at trial, acknowledging that Mr. Trump had a right to challenge the election results in court and even to lie about them, but drawing a distinction with the defendant\u2019s pursuit of \u201cunlawful means of discounting legitimate votes and subverting the election results.\u201dWhile the indictment is sprawling in laying out a case against Mr. Trump, it brings a selective lens on the multifaceted efforts by the former president and his associates to overturn the 2020 election.\u201cThe strength of the indictment is that it is very narrowly written,\u201d said Ronald S. Sullivan Jr., a Harvard Law School professor and former public defender. \u201cThe government is not attempting to prove too much, but rather it went for low-hanging fruit.\u201dFor one, Mr. Smith said little about the violent events of Jan. 6, leaving out vast amounts of evidence in the report by a House committee that separately investigated the matter. He focused more on a brazen plan to recruit false slates of electors from swing states and a pressure campaign on Vice President Mike Pence to block the congressional certification of Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s victory.That choice dovetails with Mr. Smith\u2019s decision not to charge Mr. Trump with inciting an insurrection or seditious conspiracy \u2014 potential charges the House committee recommended. By eschewing them, he avoided having the case focus on the inflammatory but occasionally ambiguous remarks Mr. Trump made to his supporters as they morphed into a mob, avoiding tough First Amendment objections that defense lawyers could raise.For another, while Mr. Smith described six of Mr. Trump\u2019s associates as co-conspirators, none were charged. It remains unclear whether some of them will eventually be indicted if they do not cooperate, or whether he intends to target only Mr. Trump so the case will move faster.ImageMr. Smith chose to say very little about the violent events of Jan. 6 and instead focused on the scheme to recruit slates of fake electors and the pressure Mr. Trump brought upon Vice President Pence.Credit...Jason Andrew for The New York TimesAmong the charges Mr. Smith did bring against Mr. Trump, corrupt obstruction of an official proceeding is the most familiar in how it applies to the aftermath of the 2020 election. Already, hundreds of ordinary Jan. 6 rioters have been charged with it.To date, most judges in Jan. 6 cases, at the district court and appeals court level, have upheld the use of the statute. But a few Trump-appointed judges have favored a more narrow interpretation, like limiting the law to situations in which people destroyed evidence or sought a benefit more concrete than having their preferred candidate win an election.Mr. Trump, of course, would have personally benefited from staying in office, making that charge stronger against him than against the rioters. Still, a possible risk is if the Supreme Court soon takes up one of the rioter cases and then narrows the scope of the law in a way that would affect the case against Mr. Trump.Proving IntentSome commentators have argued in recent days that prosecutors must persuade the jury that Mr. Trump knew his voter fraud claims were false to prove corrupt intent. But that is oversimplified, several experts said.To be sure, experts broadly agree that Mr. Smith will have an easier time winning a conviction if jurors are persuaded that Mr. Trump knew he was lying about everything. To that end, the indictment details how he \u201cwas notified repeatedly that his claims were untrue\u201d and \u201cdeliberately disregarded the truth.\u201d\u201cWhat you see in Trump \u2014 a guy who seems to inhabit his own fictional universe \u2014 is something you see in other fraud defendants,\u201d said David Alan Sklansky, a Stanford University law professor. \u201cIt\u2019s a common challenge in a fraud case to prove that at some level the defendant knew what he was telling people wasn\u2019t true. The way you prove it is, in part, by showing that lots of people made clear to the defendant that what he was saying was baseless.\u201dMoreover, the indictment emphasizes several episodes in which Mr. Trump had firsthand knowledge that his statements were false. Prosecutors can use those instances to urge jurors to infer that Mr. Trump knew he was lying about everything else, too.The indictment, for example, recounts a taped call on Jan. 2 with Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, in which Mr. Trump shared a series of conspiracy theories that Mr. Raffensperger systematically debunked in detail. But on Twitter the next day, Mr. Trump \u201cfalsely claimed that the Georgia secretary of state had not addressed\u201d the allegations.And on Jan. 5, Mr. Pence told Mr. Trump that he had no lawful authority to alter or delay the counting of Mr. Biden\u2019s electoral votes, but \u201chours later\u201d Mr. Trump issued a statement through his campaign saying the opposite: \u201cThe vice president and I are in total agreement that the vice president has the power to act.\u201dImageVice President Pence appears during House committee hearings investigating Jan. 6. The indictment suggests Mr. Trump knew he was lying about what Mr. Pence had told him on January 5.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesIn any case, several rioters have already argued that they did not have \u201ccorrupt intent\u201d because they sincerely believed the election had been stolen. That has not worked: Judges have said that corrupt intent can be shown by engaging in other unlawful actions like trespassing, assaulting the police and destroying property.\u201cBelief that your actions are serving a greater good does not negate consciousness of wrongdoing,\u201d Judge Royce C. Lamberth wrote last month.Mr. Trump, of course, did not rampage through the Capitol. But the indictment accuses him of committing other crimes \u2014 the fraud and voter disenfranchisement conspiracies \u2014 based on wrongful conduct. It cites Mr. Trump\u2019s bid to use fake electors in violation of the Electoral Count Act and his solicitation of fraud at the Justice Department and in Georgia, where he pressured Mr. Raffensperger to help him \u201cfind\u201d 11,780 votes, enough to overcome Mr. Biden\u2019s margin of victory.\u201cWhether he thinks he won or lost is relevant but not determinative,\u201d said Paul Rosenzweig, a former prosecutor who worked on the independent counsel investigation into President Bill Clinton. \u201cTrump could try to achieve vindicating his beliefs legally. The conspiracy is tied to the illegal means. So he has to say that he thought \u2018finding\u2019 11,000 votes was legal, or that fake electors were legal. That is much harder to say with a straight face.\u201dProving Mr. Trump\u2019s intent will also be key to the charges of defrauding the government and disenfranchising voters. But it may be easier because those laws do not have the heightened standard of \u201ccorrupt\u201d intent as the obstruction statute does.Court rulings interpreting the statute that criminalizes defrauding the United States, for example, have established that evidence of deception or dishonesty is sufficient. In a 1924 Supreme Court ruling, Chief Justice William H. Taft wrote that it covers interference with a government function \u201cby deceit, craft or trickery, or at least by means that are dishonest.\u201d A 1989 appeals court ruling said the dishonest actions need not be crimes in and of themselves.This factor may help explain the indictment\u2019s emphasis on the fake electors schemes in one state after another, a repetitive narrative that risks dullness: It would be hard to credibly argue that Mr. Trump and his co-conspirators thought the fake slates they submitted were real, and the indictment accuses them of other forms of trickery as well.ImageThe opening of the Michigan Electoral College session at the State Capitol in 2020.

Unlike the other charges, it had not been a major part of the public discussion of the investigation \u2014 for example, it was not among the charges recommended by the House Jan. 6 committee.Congress enacted the law after the Civil War to provide a tool for federal prosecutors to go after Southern white people, including Ku Klux Klan members, who used terrorism to prevent formerly enslaved Black people from voting. But in the 20th century, the Supreme Court upheld a broadened use of the law to address election-fraud conspiracies. The idea is that any conspiracy to engineer dishonest election results victimizes all voters in an election.\u201cIt was a good move to charge that statute, partly because that is really what this case really is about \u2014 depriving the people of the right to choose their president,\u201d said Robert S. Litt, a former federal prosecutor and a top intelligence lawyer in the Obama administration.That statute has mostly been used to address misconduct leading up to and during an election, like bribing voters or stuffing ballot boxes, rather than misconduct after an election. Still, in 1933, an appeals court upheld its use in a case involving people who reported false totals from a voter tabulation machine.It has never been used before in a conspiracy to use fake slates of Electoral College voters from multiple states to keep legitimate electors from being counted and thereby subvert the results of a presidential election \u2014 a situation that itself was unprecedented.Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers have signaled they will argue that he had a First Amendment right to say whatever he wanted. Indeed, the indictment acknowledged that it was not illegal in and of itself for Mr. Trump to lie.But in portraying Mr. Trump\u2019s falsehoods as \u201cintegral to his criminal plans,\u201d Mr. Smith suggested he would frame those public statements as contributing to unlawful actions and as evidence they were undertaken with bad intentions, not as crimes in and of themselves.ImageMr. Trump at Reagan National Airport Thursday following his court appearance. Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team has signaled they will argue that he had a First Amendment right to say whatever he wanted.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesA related defense Mr. Trump may raise is the issue of \u201cadvice of counsel.\u201d If a defendant relied in good faith on a lawyer who incorrectly informed him that doing something would be legal, a jury may decide he lacked criminal intent. But there are limits. Among them, the defendant must have told the lawyer all the relevant facts, and the theory must be \u201creasonable.\u201dThe indictment discusses how even though White House lawyers told Mr. Trump that Mr. Pence had no lawful authority to overturn Mr. Biden\u2019s victory, an outside lawyer \u2014 John Eastman, described in the indictment as Co-Conspirator 2 and who separately faces disbarment proceedings \u2014 advised him that Mr. Pence could.Several legal specialists agreed that Mr. Trump has an advice-of-counsel argument to make. But Samuel W. Buell, a Duke University law professor, said Mr. Smith was likely to try to rebut it by pointing to the repeated instances in which Mr. Trump\u2019s White House legal advisers told him that Mr. Eastman was wrong.\u201cYou have to have a genuine good-faith belief that the legal advice is legitimate and valid, not just \u2018I\u2019m going to keep running through as many lawyers as I can until one tells me something I want to hear, no matter how crazy and implausible it is,\u2019\u201d Mr. Buell said.Charlie Savage is a Washington-based national security and legal policy correspondent.

It\u2019s also a luxury motor coach that was funded by someone else\u2019s money.Justice Clarence Thomas, circa 2000, with his great-nephew and his Prevost Le Mirage XL Marathon motor coach.Credit...Supported bySKIP ADVERTISEMENTGive this articleBy Jo Becker and Julie TateAug. 5, 2023Justice Clarence Thomas met the recreational vehicle of his dreams in Phoenix, on a November Friday in 1999.With some time to kill before an event that night, he headed to a dealership just west of the airport. There sat a used Prevost Le Mirage XL Marathon, eight years old and 40 feet long, with orange flames licking down the sides. In the words of one of his biographers, \u201che kicked the tires and climbed aboard,\u201d then quickly negotiated a handshake deal. A few weeks later, Justice Thomas drove his new motor coach off the lot and into his everyman, up-by-the-bootstraps self-mythology.There he is behind the wheel during a rare 2007 interview with \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d talking about how the steel-clad converted bus allows him to escape the \u201cmeanness that you see in Washington.\u201d He regularly slips into his speeches his love of driving it through the American heartland \u2014 \u201cthe part we fly over.\u201d And in a documentary financed by conservative admirers, Justice Thomas, who was born into poverty in Georgia, waxes rhapsodic about the familiarity of spending time with the regular folks he meets along the way in R.V. parks and Walmart parking lots.\u201cI don\u2019t have any problem with going to Europe, but I prefer the United States, and I prefer seeing the regular parts of the United States,\u201d he told the filmmakers, adding: \u201cThere\u2019s something normal to me about it. I come from regular stock, and I prefer being around that.\u201dBut there is an untold, and far more complex, back story to Justice Thomas\u2019s R.V. \u2014 one that not only undercuts the mythology but also leaves unanswered a host of questions about whether the justice received, and failed to disclose, a lavish gift from a wealthy friend.His Prevost Marathon cost $267,230, according to title history records obtained by The New York Times. And Justice Thomas, who in the ensuing years would tell friends how he had scrimped and saved to afford the motor coach, did not buy it on his own. In fact, the purchase was underwritten, at least in part, by Anthony Welters, a close friend who made his fortune in the health care industry.He provided Justice Thomas with financing that experts said a bank would have been unlikely to extend \u2014 not only because Justice Thomas was already carrying a lot of debt, but because the Marathon brand\u2019s high level of customization makes its used motor coaches difficult to value.In an email to The Times, Mr. Welters wrote: \u201cHere is what I can share. Twenty-five years ago, I loaned a friend money, as I have other friends and family. We\u2019ve all been on one side or the other of that equation. He used it to buy a recreational vehicle, which is a passion of his.\u201d Roughly nine years later, \u201cthe loan was satisfied,\u201d Mr. Welters added. He subsequently sent The Times a photograph of the original title bearing his signature and a handwritten \u201clien release\u201d date of Nov. 22, 2008.But despite repeated requests over nearly two weeks, Mr. Welters did not answer further questions essential to understanding his arrangement with Justice Thomas.He would not say how much he had lent Justice Thomas, how much the justice had repaid and whether any of the debt had been forgiven or otherwise discharged. He declined to provide The Times with a copy of a loan agreement \u2014 or even say if one existed. Nor would he share the basic terms of the loan, such as what, if any, interest rate had been charged or whether Justice Thomas had adhered to an agreed-upon repayment schedule. And when asked to elaborate on what he had meant when he said the loan had been \u201csatisfied,\u201d he did not respond.\u201c\u2018Satisfied\u2019 doesn\u2019t necessarily mean someone paid the loan back,\u201d said Michael Hamersley, a tax lawyer and expert who has testified before Congress. \u201c\u2018Satisfied\u2019 could also mean the lender formally forgave the debt, or otherwise just stopped pursuing repayment.\u201dJustice Thomas, for his part, did not respond to detailed questions about the loan, sent to him through the Supreme Court\u2019s spokeswoman.The two men\u2019s silence serves to obscure whether Justice Thomas had an obligation to report the arrangement under a federal ethics law that requires justices to disclose certain gifts, liabilities and other financial dealings that could pose conflicts of interest.Vehicle loans are generally exempt from those reporting requirements, as long as they are secured by the vehicle and the loan amount doesn\u2019t exceed its purchase price. But private loans like the one between Mr. Welters and Justice Thomas can be deemed gifts or income to the borrower under the federal tax code if they don\u2019t hew to certain criteria: Essentially, experts said, the loan must have well-documented, commercially reasonable terms along the lines of what a bank would offer, and the borrower must adhere to those terms and pay back the principal and interest in full.Richard W. Painter, a White House ethics lawyer during the George W. Bush administration, said that when it comes to questions of disclosure, the ethics treatment of gifts and income often parallels the tax treatment. But those intricacies aside, he said, \u201cjustices just should not be accepting private loans from wealthy individuals outside their family.\u201d If they do, he added, \u201cyou have to ask, why is a justice going to this private individual and not to a commercial lender, unless the justice is getting something he or she otherwise could not get.\u201dThe Times\u2019s unearthing of the loan arrangement is the latest in a series of revelations showing how wealthy benefactors have bestowed an array of benefits on Justice Thomas and his wife, Virginia Thomas: helping to pay for his great-nephew\u2019s tuition, steering business to Mrs. Thomas\u2019s consulting firm, buying and renovating the house where his mother lives and inviting the Thomases on trips both domestic and foreign that included travel aboard private jets and a yacht.Justice Thomas has pointed to interpretations of the disclosure rules to defend his failure to report much of the largess he has received. He has said he was advised that the trips fell under an exemption for gifts involving \u201cpersonal hospitality\u201d from close friends, for instance, and a lawyer close to the Thomases contended in a statement that the justice did not need to disclose the tuition because it was a gift to his great-nephew, over whom he had legal custody, rather than to him.The Thomases\u2019 known benefactors include wealthy men like the Dallas real estate developer Harlan Crow, the conservative judicial kingmaker Leonard Leo and several members of the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans, which honors people who succeed despite adversity. Among them: the longtime Miami Dolphins owner Wayne Huizenga, who flew the justice around on his jet.Mr. Welters, while also a Horatio Alger member, stands apart. For one thing, the two men\u2019s friendship predates Justice Thomas\u2019s time on the federal bench. They met around 1980, when both were members of a small, informal club of Black congressional aides to Republican lawmakers \u2014 Mr. Welters worked for Senator Jacob K. Javits of New York and Justice Thomas for Senator John C. Danforth of Missouri.ImageAnthony Welters, shown with his wife Beatrice in 2016, was a close friend of Justice Thomas\u2019s from their time working as congressional aides.Credit...Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images for NYU Langone Medical Center\u201cIt wasn\u2019t exactly fashionable to be a Black person working for a Republican, and it was comforting to meet others in the same boat,\u201d the justice wrote in his autobiography, \u201cMy Grandfather\u2019s Son.\u201dThey had much in common. Like Justice Thomas, Mr. Welters was raised in poverty, sharing a cramped tenement in Harlem with his parents and three brothers and, after his mother\u2019s death when he was 8, shining shoes under an elevated subway to help make ends meet.As both men climbed the ladder as political appointees in the Reagan administration, their friendship grew. They stayed close after Justice Thomas joined the federal appeals court in Washington in 1990 and Mr. Welters left government to found AmeriChoice, a Medicaid services provider that he sold to UnitedHealthcare for $530 million in stock in 2002 and continued to lead until retiring in 2016. Mr. Welters and his wife, Beatrice, named Justice Thomas the godfather of one of their two boys, according to The Village Voice.When Justice Thomas\u2019s 1991 Supreme Court nomination ran into trouble after a former subordinate, Anita Hill, accused him of sexual harassment, Mr. Welters stood by his friend, providing behind-the-scenes advice, according to a book on the hearings written by Mr. Danforth.And in 1998, the year before the motor coach purchase, Justice Thomas returned the favor. That is when Mr. Welters and his wife, through their foundation, started the AnBryce scholarship program, which gives underprivileged students a full ride to New York University\u2019s law school, along with networking opportunities and career support. Justice Thomas lent his considerable imprimatur to the program, interviewing applicants in his Supreme Court chambers, mentoring scholars and later hiring one graduate as a clerk.By that point, the justice had become fixated on owning an R.V., and not just any R.V., but the Rolls-Royce of motor coaches: a custom Prevost Marathon, or as he once put it, a \u201ccondo on wheels.\u201dA Toy for the RichJustice Thomas was turned on to the luxury brand by Bernie Little, a fellow Horatio Alger member and the flamboyantly wealthy owner of the Miss Budweiser hydroplane racing boat. Mr. Little had owned 20 to 25 custom motor coaches over the years, Mr. Thomas told C-SPAN in 2001.Back in those days, a basic Prevost Marathon sold for about a million dollars, and could fetch far more depending on the bells and whistles. It was a rich man\u2019s toy, and the company marketed it that way.\u201cYou drive through a neighborhood in South Florida and you see these $10 million homes,\u201d Bob Phebus, Marathon\u2019s vice president, told The South Florida Business Journal in 2006. \u201cYou condense that down, put it on wheels and that\u2019s what we have. It\u2019s the same guy that will have a 100-foot yacht and a private aircraft. They\u2019re accustomed to the finer things in life.\u201dImageA circa 1991 advertisement for Marathon coaches.Credit...MarathonAt the time, the Thomases\u2019 primary source of income was the justice\u2019s salary, then $167,900. He had yet to sell his autobiography, and property and other records show that the couple had significant debt: They had purchased their house in 1992 for $552,000 with 5 percent down, then refinanced it two years later, taking out a 15-year mortgage of $496,000. Plus, they had at least one line of credit of between $15,000 and $50,000.So, in Justice Thomas\u2019s telling, he began searching for a used Prevost at Mr. Little\u2019s suggestion, one with enough miles on it to depreciate the value. \u201cThe depreciation curve \u2014 it\u2019s very steep,\u201d he made a point of saying in the 2001 C-SPAN interview.All these years later, he still hasn\u2019t told some of his closest friends how he was really able to swing the purchase.\u201cHe told me he saved up all his money to buy it,\u201d said Armstrong Williams, a longtime friend who worked closely with Justice Thomas in the Reagan administration.The title history documents reviewed by The Times show that when the motor coach was sold for $267,230 to the Thomases in 1999, it had only 93,618 miles on it, relatively few for a vehicle that experts say can easily log a million miles in its lifetime. It came equipped with plush leather seating, a kitchen, a bathroom and a bedroom in the back. In addition to its orange flame motif, it had a large Pegasus painted on the back, according to Jason Mang, the step-grandson of the previous owner, Bonnie Owenby.\u201cIt was superluxury, really bougie,\u201d he recalled.On Nov. 19, 1999, after spotting the motor coach on the lot of Desert West Coach in Phoenix and putting a hold on it, Justice Thomas attended a dinner at the conservative Goldwater Institute. In a speech that night, he said he had never yearned to be a federal judge. \u201cPure and simple, I wanted to be rich,\u201d he said.Wayne Mullis, the owner of the now-defunct Desert West, said in an interview that Justice Thomas never discussed obtaining traditional financing with him, and that \u201cas far as I know, he paid for it.\u201dIndeed, Justice Thomas would have been hard-pressed to get a loan from a traditional lender. Banks, and even finance companies that specialize in R.V. loans, are particularly reluctant to lend money on used Prevost Marathons because the customized features are hard to value, according to three leading industry executives interviewed by The Times.\u201cAs a rule, the majority of buyers are cash buyers \u2014 they don\u2019t finance the Prevost, generally,\u201d said Chad Stevens, owner of an Arizona-based dealership specializing in high-end motor coaches, whose clients include celebrities and politicians. \u201cIn 1999, you would need a very strong down payment and a strong financial portfolio to finance one. It is a luxury item.\u201dWhile the terms of Mr. Welters\u2019s loan to Justice Thomas are unclear, rules governing loans of more than $10,000 between friends and family are not.Loans can be reclassified as gifts or income to the borrower, either of which would have to be reported by the justice under court disclosure rules, if any portion of the debt is forgiven or discharged as uncollectable. But even if a lender does not take those steps, a loan can still be considered a reportable gift or income if it doesn\u2019t meet certain standards.Loan terms should be spelled out in a written agreement, with a clearly defined, regular repayment schedule, tax experts said. Lenders must charge at least the applicable federal interest rate, which was a little over 6 percent in December 1999, when the deal to buy the motor coach closed. And if a borrower is in arrears, lenders must make a good-faith effort to collect, even to the point of going to court.\u201cAbsent that, it\u2019s more of a gift,\u201d said Rich Lahijani, tax director of Edelman Financial Engines, an independent wealth planning and investment advisory firm.The title history records held by the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles do not contain detailed information about the loan itself. What they show is that when the Thomases drove their motor coach back home to Virginia, they registered it in Prince William County, which does not charge personal property tax on R.V.s stored there, unlike Fairfax County, where they live.ImageMr. Welters said he released the lien on the vehicle in 2008, and provided this photo of the original title to The Times as evidence. (Addresses and vehicle identification number have been redacted.)Credit...via Anthony WeltersAnd as of late last month, when The Times reviewed the records, they still listed Mr. Welters as the lien holder, notwithstanding the signed release he said he gave Justice Thomas in 2008 so he could obtain a new, clear title.Mr. Welters said he could not explain why he was still listed as the holder of the lien. After he gave Justice Thomas the paperwork, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what process the borrower should have followed.\u201d (To clear the title, the paperwork should have been brought to the D.M.V., where the lien release would have been recorded and a replacement title issued.) As for Justice Thomas, that was among the matters he declined to discuss with The Times.\u2018A Warm, Safe Place\u2019As details about Justice and Mrs. Thomas\u2019s subsidized trips to vacation homes and resorts have become public in recent months, his professed preference for traveling by motor coach has become something of a \u201cyeah, right\u201d punchline.But by all accounts, he loves the anonymity, the freedom and the community it affords. He has hosted at least one event at the Supreme Court for a Marathon owners\u2019 club.ImageMembers of the Marathon Coach Club International on the steps of the Supreme Court.Credit...via Marathon CoachWhen he hits the road, he often goes unrecognized, which at times has allowed him to travel without a U.S. Marshals\u2019 security detail. Chris Weaver, who worked at Desert West Coach, said the justice had frequently gotten his motor coach serviced there before it closed. \u201cNine out of 10 times, he was just wearing sweats and a T-shirt,\u201d he said.Traveling largely through red-state America has also meant that when he is recognized, more often than not it is by fans. Juan Williams, a Fox News commentator who has known Justice Thomas since the Reagan administration, said the motor coach was both the fulfillment of a boyish fantasy and a metaphorical \u201cwomb.\u201d\u201cHe talked about the R.V. a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a warm, safe place where he didn\u2019t have to be attacked by liberals and Blacks on the left. What he liked about it was not being pilloried.\u201dImageIn a 2007 interview, Justice Thomas told Steve Kroft of \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that the motor coach enabled him to escape the \u201cmeanness that you see in Washington.\u201dCredit...CBS NewsIn a 2019 Q. and A. at the court, Justice Thomas said he had made it to nearly two dozen states, and declared himself the proud owner of a KOA campground discount card.But the Thomases\u2019 road trips have hardly been limited to sleeping at campsites and Walmart parking lots.In a 2009 call-in to a morning radio talk show, for instance, Mrs. Thomas said they were driving their motor coach through the Adirondacks, on their way to \u201cmeet some families from Texas.\u201d ProPublica has reported that the Thomases have spent part of nearly every summer for the past two decades in the Adirondacks as a guest of Mr. Crow, who owns a lakeside resort there with more than 25 fireplaces, three boathouses and a painting of the justice, his host and other guests smoking cigars.ImageThe boathouse at Harlan Crow\u2019s Adirondack resort, where Justice Thomas and his wife have vacationed.Credit...Nancie Battaglia for The New York TimesWhen the Thomases aren\u2019t houseguests, they have stayed at upscale Marathon-endorsed destinations like the Mountain Falls Luxury Motorcoach Resort in Lake Toxaway, N.C.There, the justice met Larry Fields, who owns a motor-coach-cleaning business. Mr. Fields said that for several days he had had no idea who Justice Thomas was, telling him he would have to wait in line to have his Prevost washed, which he patiently did.\u201cHe was a great guy,\u201d Mr. Fields recalled. \u201cI think we talked about how great Reagan was. He was low-key. It was just him and his wife and a dog.\u201dImageJustice and Mrs. Thomas have traveled to Mountain Falls, a luxury motor coach resort in North Carolina.Credit...Greg EastmanUpkeep on a motor coach like the justice\u2019s is an expensive constant, and other friends have chipped in to help. While he did not disclose Mr. Welters\u2019s assistance in buying the motor coach, he did report that some former clerks got together and bought him deep-cycle batteries for $1,200 the year after he acquired it. He also reported that in 2002, Greg Werner, who ran a large, family-owned, Nebraska-based trucking company, gave him tires worth $1,200.And over time, Justice Thomas made the motor coach his own. In a photo The Times obtained that appears to date back to the early 2000s, picturing his great-nephew as a child, the motor coach no longer sported the sizzling orange flames and Pegasus logo. Instead, it was painted in an elegant black-and-gold geometric pattern.But if the custom coach changed, the justice\u2019s friendship with Mr. Welters endured.While Mr. Welters was an executive at UnitedHealthcare, Justice Thomas twice recused himself from cases involving the company, in 2003 and 2005. As is the general custom of the court, he did not explain why.In 2010, Justice Thomas traveled to the capital of Trinidad and Tobago, Port of Spain, at the invitation of the Welterses. By then, the couple had become major Democratic fund-raisers and President Obama had named Ms. Welters ambassador to the island nation. Local newspapers captured the justice and Mr. Welters talking to students at a school.ImageJustice Thomas at a school in Trinidad and Tobago in 2010 with Mr. Welters, left, whose wife was the ambassador. Flight records show that the Welterses\u2019 private plane flew to and from Dulles Airport on the days Justice Thomas traveled.Credit...U.S. Embassy Trinidad and TobagoIn disclosures, Justice Thomas wrote that the \u201cU.S. Embassy Port of Spain\u201d had paid for his flight. But flight records obtained through the plane-tracking services of MyRadar show that the Welterses\u2019 private Gulfstream G-6 flew from Washington Dulles International Airport and back on the days that Justice Thomas arrived on and departed the Caribbean island.And Matthew Cassetta, a retired embassy official who helped arrange the visit, said Ms. Welters customarily \u201coffered the plane to people who came down,\u201d always at her own expense to save the taxpayers money.(Ms. Welters declined to comment on the flights or the loan, except to say, \u201cI just want to tell you that friendships come and go, and that\u2019s what I want to say.\u201d)The same year, in a speech accepting an award from the Horatio Alger Association, Justice Thomas singled out Mr. Welters as one of his \u201cfriends for the whole journey.\u201d\u201cAnd for Tony, a special thank you, who understood relationships and who was always there as a friend in the worst times of my life,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a friendship I will treasure forever.\u201dReporting was contributed by Steve Eder, Riley Mellen, Robin Stein and Abbie VanSickle.Jo Becker is a reporter in the investigative unit and a three-time Pulitzer Prize winner.

Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania last week. Mr. Trump has a history of lashing out on social media at the prosecutors bringing criminal charges against him.Credit...Maddie McGarvey for The New York TimesBy Alan Feuer and Maggie HabermanAug. 5, 2023Updated 10:52 a.m. ETThe federal prosecutors overseeing the indictment of former President Donald J. Trump on charges of seeking to overturn the 2020 election asked a judge on Friday night to impose a protective order over the discovery evidence in the case, citing a threatening message that Mr. Trump had posted on social media.By mentioning the incendiary post in an otherwise routine request seeking to keep Mr. Trump from making evidence public, the prosecutors in the office of the special counsel, Jack Smith, were drawing the attention of the judge, Tanya S. Chutkan, to Mr. Trump\u2019s longstanding habit of attacking those involved in criminal cases against him.Hours later, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign responded with a statement calling the post \u201cthe definition of political speech.\u201d The statement suggested that the post had not been directed at anyone involved in the election interference case, saying it was meant for Mr. Trump\u2019s political adversaries.The exchange of words began on Friday evening when Mr. Trump posted a message on Truth Social, his social media platform, issuing a vague but strongly worded threat.\u201cIF YOU GO AFTER ME, I\u2019M COMING AFTER YOU!\u201d he wrote.Shortly after, in a standard move early in a criminal prosecution, the government filed its request for a protective order in the case to Judge Chutkan. Prosecutors noted that protections over discovery were \u201cparticularly important\u201d in this instance because Mr. Trump \u201chas previously issued public statements on social media regarding witnesses, judges, attorneys and others associated with legal matters pending against him.\u201dTo prove their point, they included a screenshot of the former president\u2019s threatening post from that same evening.A short time after the government\u2019s filing, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign issued a statement with no aide\u2019s name attached, insisting he was practicing his First Amendment rights.\u201cThe Truth post cited is the definition of political speech,\u201d the statement said, adding that it was in response to \u201cdishonest special interest groups\u201d and political committees attacking him.That Mr. Trump is a political candidate exercising free speech is going to be an element of his defense in the latest case against him. Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign on Friday also posted on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, a 60-second ad describing the prosecutors who have considered cases against him as the \u201cfraud squad\u201d acting on behalf of President Biden. (It includes the New York attorney general, Letitia James, who has brought a civil action case.)The ad is one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most aggressive denigrations of the prosecutors, whom he has consistently denounced. He has also promised that if elected, he would appoint a \u201creal\u201d special prosecutor to investigate Mr. Biden and his family, proposing to eliminate the post-Watergate norm of Justice Department independence.But the Truth Social post was more direct than his past comments, in a case where a key aspect of the indictment describes how Mr. Trump\u2019s repeated and false public claims that he was a victim of widespread election fraud led to the violent attack by a pro-Trump mob at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.Judge Chutkan, who was randomly assigned the case when the indictment was filed on Tuesday, has not yet responded to the government\u2019s request. But other judges in cases involving Mr. Trump have warned him about using threatening language.At a court hearing in Manhattan in April, Justice Juan M. Merchan, who is overseeing Mr. Trump\u2019s state prosecution on charges stemming from a hush payment to a porn actress, warned the former president to refrain from making comments that were \u201clikely to incite violence or civil unrest.\u201dJustice Merchan\u2019s admonition came after Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social saying that \u201cdeath and destruction\u201d could follow if he were charged in the case in Manhattan.That same month, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, who was presiding over a federal rape and defamation lawsuit filed by the writer E. Jean Carroll against Mr. Trump, criticized the former president for posting messages about the case. The ones he had already written were \u201centirely inappropriate,\u201d the judge said.Mr. Trump had derided the case on social media as a \u201cscam\u201d and personally mocked Ms. Carroll.The former president has often ignored such warnings and continued to post threatening or spiteful messages with impunity.After the hearing in front of Justice Merchan, Mr. Trump returned to Florida and to his customary practice, calling the district attorney who brought the New York charges against him, Alvin L. Bragg, a \u201ccriminal,\u201d and Justice Merchan \u201ca Trump-hating judge with a Trump-hating wife and family.\u201dDays after Judge Kaplan\u2019s admonition, Mr. Trump attacked him, too, saying on a trip to one of his golf courses in Ireland that the judge was \u201cextremely hostile.\u201dAlan Feuer covers extremism and political violence.

Mr. DeSantis pitched his economic plans in the state, but could not entirely escape the drumbeat of news from Washington.Credit...Rachel Mummey for The New York TimesBy Lisa Lerer and Nicholas NehamasNicholas Nehamas reported from Decorah, Iowa.Aug. 5, 2023, 5:00 a.m. ETDays after the front-runner was indicted on charges of trying to subvert an election, Republican candidates in their presidential primary returned to the campaign trail acting as if nothing had changed.Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida scooped ice cream in Iowa as he pitched his economic plans. Senator Tim Scott met community leaders at the southern border with a promise to get tough on immigration. Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor, showed up in Ukraine, a dramatic attempt to focus on foreign policy. And former Vice President Mike Pence talked up the \u201cTrump-Pence administration\u201d record at a town hall in New Hampshire.But their dogged attempts to create a political safe space \u2014 an indictment-free zone, where they are not asked to defend or attack former President Donald J. Trump, the dominant leader in the race and the party\u2019s most powerful figure \u2014 kept failing.Reporters asked questions about stolen-election lies and presidential pardons. Voters wanted to know what they thought of the new charges. Trump supporters greeted Mr. Pence with a sign calling him a \u201ctraitor.\u201d Mr. Trump, too, had thoughts.\u201cEvery time they file an indictment, we go way up in the polls,\u201d he said at a Republican Party dinner in Montgomery, Ala., on Friday night. \u201cWe need one more indictment to close out this election.\u201dThe scenes demonstrated the nearly impossible challenge before the Republican field as the candidates soldier on in a primary like no other. As Mr. Trump rallies Republicans to his side against what he says is a political persecution, how can they move beyond a past election to talk about the future?For months, their strategy has been simple: Ignore, deflect and change the subject. But it\u2019s an approach that became significantly harder this week, as the felony counts against Mr. Trump grew to number 78 across three criminal cases with the addition of a federal indictment in a Washington, D.C., federal court accusing him of conspiring to defraud the government and to obstruct an official proceeding, as well as other crimes.Addressing voters at a brewery in northeast Iowa on Friday morning, Mr. DeSantis focused on his usual themes: his record as Florida governor, his biography as a father and a military veteran, and his plans on immigration and economic policy. But he could not entirely escape the drumbeat of news from Washington.When a member of the audience asked whether he thought Mr. Trump\u2019s latest indictment was a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d Mr. DeSantis responded that the case was \u201cpolitically motivated, absolutely,\u201d and pledged to end the \u201cweaponization\u201d of federal government.ImageMr. DeSantis tried to steer the conversation away from former President Donald J.

Mr. DeSantis suggested he would \u2014 before quickly trying to recast the race as about the future.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s in the best interest of the country to have a former president that\u2019s almost 80 years old go to prison,\u201d the governor, 44, told reporters at a tire shop in Waverly, Iowa. \u201cAnd just like Ford pardoned Nixon, sometimes you\u2019ve got to put this stuff behind you, and we need to start focusing on things having to do with the country\u2019s future.\u201dHe added: \u201cThis election needs to be about Jan. 20, 2025, not Jan. 6, 2021.\u201dStill, there were some signs that the newest charges had pushed Mr. DeSantis, whose campaign is under pressure to appeal to more moderate voters, to inch toward criticism of Mr. Trump. After his event, he acknowledged that claims about the 2020 election\u2019s having been stolen were \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d \u2014 a more direct response than he typically gives when asked about Mr. Trump\u2019s defeat.\u201cAll those theories that were put out did not prove to be true,\u201d Mr. DeSantis said in response to a reporter\u2019s question.Part of the challenge for Mr. Trump\u2019s opponents is that even Republicans who want to move past the former president defend him. Sandy Lloyd, a 61-year-old fourth-grade teacher, said she did not plan to vote for Mr. Trump, having grown tired of the frequent controversies surrounding him. Yet she said that she thought the election had been stolen and that she didn\u2019t want to see Mr. DeSantis attack Mr. Trump.\u201cIf I\u2019m going for a new job, I don\u2019t go into my interview and attack everybody else \u2014 I tell them why they want me,\u201d Ms. Lloyd said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I want to hear. Why do I want you as president?\u201dOthers took a different view, arguing that the criminal charges against Mr. Trump would weaken him in a general election.James Smith, a supporter of Mr. DeSantis who drove from Wisconsin to see the governor, said he wanted the Florida governor to be aggressive.\u201cI would love for him to go harder against Trump,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to win the Republican nomination by not going after the leader. The only way to shake up the race is by attacking.\u201dImageSupporters of Mr. Trump outside a town hall event featuring former Vice President Mike Pence in Londonderry, N.H.Credit...Joe Buglewicz for The New York TimesBut no candidate has a harder time escaping the political realities of the Trump indictments than Mr. Pence, who told prosecutors that Mr. Trump had pressured him to reject electoral votes in an attempt to disrupt the transfer of power.About a dozen Trump supporters gathered outside the American Legion post where Mr. Pence spoke Friday evening. They heckled him as he entered.\u201cWhat Pence did is, he committed treason \u2014 that\u2019s the bottom line,\u201d said Derek Arnold, a protester from Derry, N.H. \u201cHe had the choice to do the right thing. And that man knows right from wrong, and we\u2019re here to let him know that he did us wrong.\u201dWhen Mr. Pence told a standing crowd of around 100 people that he had \u201cstood loyally by President Trump,\u201d his comment prompted scoffing from some in the room. But he was applauded after he finished his thought: \u201cAnd I never changed my commitment to him until the day came that my oath to the Constitution required me to do otherwise.\u201dImageMr. Pence answering questions during a campaign town hall event Friday night in Londonderry, N.H.Credit...Joe Buglewicz for The New York TimesAsked if he would pardon Mr. Trump, Mr. Pence was noncommittal.\u201cI really don\u2019t understand why some candidates in the Republican primary are assuming that the president is going to be found guilty in these various cases,\u201d Mr. Pence said. \u201cLet him make his case in court, and if I have the privilege of being president of the United States, whatever pardon request comes before me, I\u2019ll always give a thoughtful, prayerful consideration.\u201dAround a dozen people in the crowd said they were still making up their minds on whom to support. Some were looking for a Trump alternative, but not all considered the charges against him disqualifying.\u201cI feel bad that the country has to go through that, never mind Trump himself,\u201d Fran York said of the prosecutions of Mr. Trump. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that what he did was so bad that he should be indicted.\u201dMr. York, who is supporting Mr. Pence, said he would vote for Mr. Trump again if he won the nomination.Mr. Scott, who has said little about the election indictment, went to Yuma, Ariz., to promote his plan to spend $10 billion on the border wall started by Mr. Trump. There, too, he repeated his accusation that the Justice Department was \u201chunting Republicans.\u201d\u201cMy perspective is that the D.O.J. continues to weaponize their power against political opponents,\u201d he said, deflecting a question from an NBC reporter about whether Mr. Trump\u2019s legal cases were dominating the campaign.Perhaps the only candidate other than Mr. Trump who was eager to talk about the indictment was Mr. Christie, who has focused his campaign on undercutting the former president. Mr. Christie has struggled to break 3 percent in recent polling of the contest.\u201cIt\u2019s an aggressive indictment,\u201d he said from a train headed to Kyiv, Ukraine, on Thursday night. \u201cBut what I believe is a much more important question than the criminality, in the context of this campaign season, is the fact that he\u2019s morally responsible for Jan. 6.\u201dCharles Homans contributed from Kyiv, Ukraine; Maya King from Montgomery, Ala.; Anjali Huynh from Londonderry, N.H.; and Neil Vigdor from Columbia, S.C.Lisa Lerer is a national political correspondent, covering campaigns, elections and political power.

Trump\u2019s growing cast of lawyers is marked by a web of overlapping interests encompassing witnesses, co-defendants and potential targets.Give this articleBy Alan Feuer,\u00a0Ben Protess and Maggie HabermanAug. 5, 2023Updated 9:37 a.m. ETM. Evan Corcoran, a lawyer who accompanied former President Donald J. Trump to court this week for his arraignment on charges of trying to overturn the 2020 election, has given crucial evidence in Mr. Trump\u2019s other federal case \u2014 the one accusing him of illegally hoarding classified documents.Another lawyer close to Mr. Trump, Boris Epshteyn, sat for an interview with prosecutors this spring and could be one of the former president\u2019s co-conspirators in the election tampering case.And Mr. Epshteyn\u2019s lawyer, Todd Blanche, is defending Mr. Trump against both the documents and election case indictments.The legal team that Mr. Trump has assembled to represent him in the twin prosecutions by the special counsel, Jack Smith, is marked by a tangled web of potential conflicts and overlapping interests \u2014 so much so that Mr. Smith\u2019s office has started asking questions.While it is not uncommon for lawyers in complex matters \u2014 like large mob cases or financial inquiries \u2014 to wear many hats or to play competing roles, the Gordian knot of intertwined imperatives in the Trump investigations is particularly intricate and insular.Some of the lawyers involved in the cases are representing both charged defendants and uncharged witnesses. At least one could eventually become a defendant, and another could end up as a witness in one case and Mr. Trump\u2019s defender in a different one.All of that sits atop another thorny fact: Many of the lawyers are being paid by Save America PAC, Mr. Trump\u2019s political action committee, which has itself been under government scrutiny for months. Some of the witnesses those lawyers represent work for the Trump Organization, Mr. Trump\u2019s company, but their legal defense has not been arranged by the company, but rather by Mr. Trump\u2019s own legal team, a person with knowledge of the matter said.Although clients might choose to stick with their lawyers despite a conflict, just this week, prosecutors under Mr. Smith sent up a warning flare about these issues. They asked Judge Aileen M. Cannon, who is overseeing the documents case, to conduct a hearing \u201cregarding potential conflicts\u201d arising from the complex client list of one lawyer, Stanley Woodward Jr.Mr. Woodward represents Walt Nauta, Mr. Trump\u2019s personal aide and one of his co-defendants in the documents case. Mr. Woodward has also worked for at least three witnesses in the broader inquiry who could be called to testify at trial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStanley Woodward Jr.\nLAWYER\n\n\nIs a lawyer for ...\n\n\nIs also a lawyer for ...\n\n\nWalt Nauta\nCo-defendant\n\n\nThree witnesses\n\n\nDonald J.

Trump\ndefendant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of those witnesses, Yuscil Taveras, an information technology worker at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump\u2019s private club and residence in Florida, recently provided prosecutors with potentially incriminating information about Mr. Nauta after parting ways with Mr. Woodward and getting a new lawyer.In a motion to Judge Cannon filed on Wednesday, prosecutors said that given all of this, Mr. Woodward could have \u201cdivided loyalties\u201d and asked the judge to inform Mr. Woodward\u2019s clients about the \u201cpotential risks\u201d they face.Prosecutors appear to have similar qualms about another lawyer in the documents case, John Irving, who represents Carlos De Oliveira, Mr. Trump\u2019s other co-defendant, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Irving\u2019s client list also includes three witnesses who were interviewed by investigators and could, in theory, end up on the stand.Mr. Woodward has signaled that he will not contest the need to hold a hearing. And he and Mr. Irving, both of whom declined to comment, disclosed the potential conflicts to their clients early on, informing them that there could come a point when they would need new lawyers, according to people familiar with the matter.In a statement, Steven Cheung, a spokesman for Mr. Trump, argued that it would be normal for the judge to hold a hearing to consider the potential conflicts, describing it as \u201ccommonplace\u201d in such a broad case.\u201cThere is nothing unusual or concerning about any court confirming that President Trump and others are aware of any potential waivable conflicts issues, of which they all are certainly already aware,\u201d he said. \u201cAny attempt to read into this or otherwise guess about the president\u2019s legal strategy is ridiculous and sad.\u201dStill, the complexities surrounding the case are extensive and have raised concerns for prosecutors.\u201cThis is boundary breaking,\u201d Bruce Green, who teaches legal ethics at Fordham Law School in New York, said about the totality of the issues involved. \u201cWhat I\u2019m most curious about is why these lawyers want to play so many roles. Usually, lawyers just want to be lawyers.\u201dThe potential conflicts confronting the lawyers in Mr. Trump\u2019s prosecutions come from a variety of sources.Some involve situations in which the lawyers could be put in the untenable position of cross-examining a former client in the service of defending a current one. Others stem from bumping up against the guardrails put in place to keep lawyers from advocating for their clients with one hand while possibly incriminating them with the other.Then there is the issue of the lawyers\u2019 bills largely being paid by Mr. Trump\u2019s political action committee. That situation, said Stephen Gillers, a legal ethics professor at New York University, was theoretically not all that unusual. Organizations often foot the bill for employees who need legal representation resulting from \u201cthe scope of their employment,\u201d he said.Still, Mr. Gillers said, problems can arise when the entity paying the fees chooses or steers a lawyer toward a client and that lawyer has competing loyalties when it comes to the payer and the client\u2019s best interests.Many potential objections to conflicts in these cases could be waived by the clients or otherwise mitigated by the courts, Mr. Green said. But he cautioned that judges often lean toward avoiding conflicts at all costs \u2014 up to and including disqualifying lawyers who face them \u2014 because the consequences of allowing them to continue could result in the dismissal of the case.One of the most awkward situations in a Trump-related case came on Thursday when the former president was accompanied to his arraignment on election interference charges by Mr. Corcoran, a lawyer who had worked with him before on both that matter and the documents case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM.

Trump\nDEFENDANT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr. Corcoran\u2019s presence in the courtroom was somewhat unexpected because five months ago a federal judge had ordered him to provide Mr. Smith with the extensive audio notes he made about his work for Mr. Trump. The recorded notes were handed over after the judge determined that Mr. Trump had likely misled Mr. Corcoran and tried to use his legal services to commit a crime \u2014 an exception to the attorney-client privilege that would normally protect such recordings.The audio notes, in which Mr. Corcoran described assisting Mr. Trump to comply with a subpoena that demanded all of the classified materials in his possession, played a central role in the indictment that was filed in June accusing Mr. Trump of illegally retaining more than 30 sensitive documents after leaving office.The notes laid out in detail how Mr. Trump pressured Mr. Corcoran to prevent investigators from reclaiming classified material, according to the indictment, suggesting that he \u201chide or destroy documents called for by the grand jury subpoena.\u201dProsecutors are likely to call Mr. Corcoran as a witness at Mr. Trump\u2019s documents trial in Florida, even as he might continue to assist the former president\u2019s defense team on the election case in Washington, people with knowledge of the matter have said. Mr. Smith\u2019s prosecutors have inquired about Mr. Corcoran\u2019s role in the election case, but have not yet signaled that they plan to object to it.Although he was in court on Thursday, Mr. Corcoran has not formally appeared on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf in the case. And if there were a conflict, Mr. Trump could choose to waive potential objections to it. It is unclear why Mr. Trump, who prizes loyalty, would continue to want Mr. Corcoran\u2019s assistance.But it could be part of a long-shot challenge to the so-called crime-fraud exception that permitted the notes to be handed over in the documents case.\u201cThere is a rule called the advocate-witness rule that forbids lawyers from occupying both roles, and Trump may believe it will be easier to keep Corcoran off the stand and to exclude his grand jury testimony if he remains on the trial team,\u201d Mr. Gillers said.A different twist emerged on Tuesday when the election case indictment was handed up in Washington. The charges mentioned six co-conspirators who helped Mr. Trump to execute his plans. One of them \u2014 Co-Conspirator 6 \u2014 was described as a \u201cpolitical consultant\u201d who assisted Mr. Trump in what has become known as the \u201cfake electors\u201d scheme.While prosecutors have not identified Co-Conspirator 6, an email obtained by The New York Times suggests that it could be Mr. Epshteyn, a lawyer and strategic adviser to Mr. Trump who was paid for political consulting in 2020 and who has served throughout the recent investigations as one of his top advisers and his in-house counsel. The email\u2019s contents and its recipient \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s former lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who is Co-Conspirator 1 in the indictment \u2014 match that of an email described in the indictment as sent by Co-conspirator 6.It would be an uncomfortable development, to say the least, if Mr. Epshteyn, who often travels with the former president and accompanied him to his arraignment on Thursday, was also an unnamed, unindicted participant in the case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTodd Blanche\nLAWYER\n\n\nBoris Epshteyn\nLAWYER\n\n\nIs a lawyer for...\n\n\nIs in-house\ncounsel for ...\n\n\nWas a possible\nco-conspirator in the\nJan. 6 case with ...\n\n\nIs a lawyer in the Jan. 6\nand classified documents\ncases for ...\n\n\nDonald J.

Vasyl Malyuk, the head of the Security Service of Ukraine, said the country was responsible for recent attacks on Russian vessels, calling them a \u201clogical\u201d and \u201ceffective\u201d tactic \u2014 without explicitly mentioning Saturday\u2019s strike.The tanker was near the Kerch Strait Bridge, a vital connection for Russia to the Crimean Peninsula, which has been under Russian occupation since 2014. Mr. Malyuk suggested that Ukraine would continue attacking the bridge until Russian forces completely withdrew from Ukrainian lands.Russia accused Ukraine of attacking the bridge itself last month, also with sea drones.The attack on Saturday was an apparent continuation of Ukraine\u2019s challenge to Moscow\u2019s control of the Black Sea. A day earlier, the country\u2019s forces had demonstrated the expanding reach of their uncrewed vessels by hitting a Russian naval ship near the Russian port of Novorossiysk, more than 400 miles by sea from the nearest Ukrainian-held shores.ImageA satellite image released by Planet Labs showed a damaged Russian warship near the port of Novorossiysk, Russia, on Friday.Credit...Planet Labs PBC, via Associated PressThe Russian agency said the vessel damaged on Saturday was the oil and chemical tanker Sig, and that it had been approaching the Kerch Strait Bridge from the south with a crew of 11. Rybar, a popular Russian pro-war blog, said the tanker was returning from delivering oil to Syria.In the attack the previous day near Novorossiysk, a Russian shipping and naval hub on the northeastern shore of the Black Sea, a naval drone appeared to slam into a Ropucha-class landing ship that was later seen listing to its port side in photos and videos verified by The New York Times.Three Ukrainian officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military matters, said the attack in Novorossiysk had been carried out by the Security Service of Ukraine and the Ukrainian Navy.A correction was made on\u00a0Aug. 5, 2023:\u00a0An earlier version of this article misstated how many Russian ports were labeled at \u201cwar risk\u201d in a warning from Ukraine\u2019s maritime authority and the date from which that risk began. It referred to six Russian ports on the Black Sea, not all of them, and was starting on Aug. 4, not Aug. 23.How we handle correctionsVictoria Kim is a correspondent based in Seoul, focused on international breaking news coverage.

A priest stopped to wipe away her tears. \u201cThe pope \u2014 I don\u2019t think so.\u201dSince declining to name Russia as the aggressor early in the war, Pope Francis has repeatedly expressed solidarity with the Ukrainian people, even calling them \u201cmartyred.\u201d But his methods of pursuing peace \u2014 including a secret mission that baffled Ukrainian officials, and a reluctance to more fulsomely condemn Russia and President Vladimir V. Putin \u2014 have bothered many of the Ukrainian Catholics who came to this week\u2019s major meeting of Catholic youth from around the world.Image\u201cSo many people are showing us support,\u201d said Anastasiia Koval, center.Credit...Jason Horowitz/The New York TimesBefore his arrival on Saturday in F\u00e1tima, in central Portugal, the Vatican said that Francis would pray there for peace in Ukraine and the world while bringing Russia\u2019s invasion back into view. But after praying silently in front of the town\u2019s shrine and a statue of the Virgin Mary, he made no mention of a prayer for peace or Ukraine, and instead reiterated his central World Youth Day message that there is room for everyone in the church.The pope said \u201cnothing,\u201d said the Rev. Roman Demush, who leads the youth ministry office for the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. \u201cThe war should make us scream, and it silences.\u201dF\u00e1tima itself has links to Russia that go back more than a century. The town is best-known in Catholic tradition for three secret, apocalyptic prophesies said to be delivered to three children by an apparition of the Virgin Mary in 1917, when it was a poor village. One of the children went on to become a nun, and said that one prophecy had been that peace would reign on Earth if the pope and the world\u2019s bishops converted Russia, which became Communist in the year of the apparitions, and consecrated the nation to the \u201cImmaculate Heart of Mary.\u201dThe prophecy has drawn renewed attention since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, and the roughly 500 young Ukrainians who made the trip to World Youth Day in Lisbon this week started their pilgrimage in F\u00e1tima. Fifteen of them also met with Francis at the Vatican embassy in Lisbon.ImagePilgrims waiting for the pope\u2019s arrival in F\u00e1tima on Saturday.Credit...Marco Bertorello/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty ImagesBut for those hoping that he might take up their cause at World Youth Day, there was disappointment, just as there was last year when Francis delivered a prayer for peace that consecrated both Russia and Ukraine to Mary, leaving many Ukrainians feeling lumped in with their aggressors.\u201cHe said he was impotent in front of this evil,\u201d Father Demush said after the meeting, adding that the pope had expressed frustration at being unable to stop the violence. Mostly, he said, the pope listened intensely as the young Ukrainian pilgrims spoke about their suffering in the war and the friends and family they had lost.One of the young people, Valentyna Velychko, 17, from Melitopol, said she had spoken of her life under occupation and the experience of having missiles fall on her town, how three of her friends had been killed, and how her boyfriend had lost limbs after stepping on a land mine.Dmytro Bohak, 19, said he had told the pope about injuries he suffered while driving ambulances and other vehicles into Ukraine. He also recalled how another girl had brought tears to the pope\u2019s eyes when she told him that she could no longer recognize her own father, who was disfigured physically and spiritually by the war.But Mr. Bohak said that what was really needed was action by Francis.\u201cIt\u2019s not enough just to listen \u2014 he has to do something,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want the pope to be clear, in an understandable way, that Russia is a terrorist state.\u201dImage\u201cThe war should make us scream, and it silences,\u201d said the Rev. Roman Demush, who leads the youth ministry office for the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church.Credit...Jason Horowitz/The New York TimesOn Friday afternoon, the larger Ukrainian group set up on the curve of a central Lisbon thoroughfare leading to the park where the pope solemnly commemorated the Way of the Cross. They sang their anthem between the Christian rock songs that boomed from the loudspeakers, and dispatched the members who spoke English to talk to the young people marching by.\u201cRussia kills us everyday,\u201d Vira Ivanchuk, 24, told some Spanish girls who had stopped to look at the rows of Ukrainians. \u201cThe faces on the shirts are a small percentage of the children they are killing.\u201dWhen they left, Ms. Ivanchuk explained why she had felt it necessary to make her case.\u201cI understand that this is maybe not the place, a festival, where people want to talk about this,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we need more weapons. We need F-16s, because we don\u2019t have aerial capabilities. We need more weapons, support, economic sanctions, and please pray for us.\u201dThe park continued to fill with 800,000 young Catholics as the Ukrainians stood mostly immobile. Some traded traditional Ukrainian dolls with Americans who gave out red, white and blue rubber bracelets.Olena Syniuhu, 19, from Lviv, who handed out the dolls, said she had been nervous that some of the young people \u2014 especially Americans, who she said had \u201cgiven such a huge support to us\u201d \u2014 would be exasperated with them. Instead, she said, she found herself next to a group of teenagers from Miami on Thursday night who made it abundantly clear \u201cthey were with us. I could see it in their eyes, it was like free therapy.\u201dMs. Syniuhu said she hadn\u2019t seen any Russians there, \u201cand I don\u2019t want to see any.\u201dOther pilgrims stopped to embrace the Ukrainians.\u201cIt seemed like the right thing to do,\u201d said Anna Susanetto, 18, from Italy, who hugged the girls.\u201cI wanted to tell them that I\u2019m with them and against Russia,\u201d said Kristina Kosarkova, 16, from the Czech Republic. \u201cI want the pope to unite the world for Ukraine, and against Russia.\u201dJosephine Jos\u00e9 Alimene, 27, from Mozambique, wept when she saw the rows of Ukrainians.

As pilgrims rushed forward to get a better look, the Ukrainians stood still.Ms. Koval expressed hope that Francis would use his F\u00e1tima visit to pray for them.\u201cI don\u2019t want him to say that Ukraine must forgive Russia, because a lot of our people are dying and we will never forgive them,\u201d she said through tears. \u201cAnd I hate Russia for that.\u201dJason Horowitz is the Rome bureau chief, covering Italy, the Vatican, Greece and other parts of Southern Europe.

Jolted by a Mutiny, Putin Works the Crowds.His contained interactions with crowds this summer are a noticeable change for the Russian leader, who disdains retail politics and operated in extreme seclusion during the pandemic.Give this articleA photograph provided by the Russian state news media showed President Vladimir V. Putin holding a child in Kronstadt, near St. Petersburg, last month.Credit...Alexander Demyanchuk/Sputnik, via ReutersBy Paul SonneAug. 5, 2023, 5:01 a.m. ETHe worked a throng of screaming fans in Dagestan. He hoisted a young girl onto his hip in Kronstadt. He posed shoulder-to-shoulder with seven young siblings, shaking their father\u2019s hand after a naval parade.President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is newly out and about, pressing the flesh of the Russian people, in a bid to demonstrate that his years of pandemic-induced isolation are over and that his public support remains strong despite the war in Ukraine and a failed mutiny against his government.His behavior is a noticeable change for the Russian president, who cultivated extreme seclusion during the pandemic, forcing visiting leaders to sit at the opposite end of giant oblong tables and requiring people to quarantine for up to two weeks to see him.The isolation persisted until well after politicians elsewhere had dispensed with such precautions amid receding fears about Covid-19. And once Russia invaded Ukraine, Mr. Putin\u2019s distance stood in stark contrast to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, who made regular visits to frontline positions, crowded ceremonies and cramped hospital rooms.Though many precautions remain in place, and Mr. Putin hardly rivals President Biden on an Iowa rope line, the Russian leader is noticeably interacting with crowds in orchestrated appearances \u2014 portraying himself as in touch and in charge after the rebellion by the Wagner private militia suggested that he was neither.ImageDuring the pandemic, Mr. Putin\u2019s interactions were marked by extreme distancing, as in a meeting in Moscow with President Emmanuel Macron of France in early 2022, in this photo released by the Russian state news media. Credit...Sputnik, via Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\u201cWhat about the quarantine?\u201d a journalist called out to Mr. Putin last month as the Russian leader worked a crowd in Kronstadt.\u201cThe people are more important than quarantine,\u201d Mr. Putin shot back.Mr. Putin has long loathed populist retail politics, deriding the sort of baby kissing required of American politicians campaigning for office as frivolous and vulgar.His attempts at impromptu interaction with the Russian populace over the years have often come off as wooden or peculiar, such as when he lifted the shirt of a young boy and kissed his belly in a 2006 appearance at the Kremlin. (Mr. Putin later said he had wanted to cuddle him like a kitten, a discordant image for a former K.G.B. lieutenant colonel.)The Russian leader has preferred more controlled events, often inspecting production facilities and meeting with worker collectives, holding court over subordinate officials, presiding over military ceremonies or cutting the image of a rugged outdoorsman in carefully orchestrated publicity stunts, sometimes with animals.Much of that active image fell away with the pandemic, when Mr. Putin began to come across as more of a withdrawn autocrat \u2014 beaming in from behind a desk over a flat screen, at one point to launch an ill-planned war.But an aborted June 24 mutiny by Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, the mercenary tycoon, seems to have changed the calculation for the Russian leader.ImageFighters of the Wagner private mercenary group near the headquarters of Russia\u2019s Southern Military District in the city of Rostov-on-Don in June.Credit...ReutersDays after Mr. Prigozhin\u2019s uprising, Mr. Putin traveled to Derbent, a city in Russia\u2019s southern Dagestan region, and appeared before a crowd screaming with delight \u2014 a boisterous encounter the likes of which Russia had not seen from its leader in years.His spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, later said that Mr. Putin had gone against the \u201cstrong recommendations from experts\u201d and made a \u201cfirm decision\u201d to interact with the crowd, because \u201che couldn\u2019t refuse these people and not greet them.\u201dTatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, said the decision to work the crowd was almost certainly Mr. Putin\u2019s personal choice \u2014 designed in part to send the message to Russia\u2019s elite that he maintains the adoration of the nation\u2019s public.\u201cPrigozhin\u2019s rebellion \u2014 that was the strongest blow to the legitimacy of the leadership,\u201d Ms. Stanovaya said. \u201cAnd where does legitimacy come from? From the people. Therefore, the desire to throw oneself into the people and feel you are supported, it\u2019s the kind of need that arises against the backdrop of a rebellion.\u201dMr. Putin\u2019s appearances with crowds have continued in the days since.On July 23, he took the Belarusian president, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, to Kronstadt, a city on an island outside St. Petersburg known for its early-20th-century history of mutinies. The two leaders mingled with a crowd outside a cathedral, where Mr. Putin stood between a bride and groom. He lifted a smiling girl with pink sunglasses on her head.Days later, the Russian president hosted top African leaders in St. Petersburg, his home city.If the summit, with its limited roster of African heads of state, failed to solve Russia\u2019s geopolitical isolation, it did address the enduring images of Mr. Putin\u2019s physical isolation. In a marathon of photo ops, meetings and excursions, the Russian leader had perhaps more sustained personal contact than at any time since before the pandemic, certainly with international officials.The Russian leader glad-handed African leaders of all levels as well as their spouses, hosted a gala dinner and entertained some officials who stayed on for Russia\u2019s traditional Navy Day parade of warships on the Neva River. He returned to Kronstadt flanked by Russian defense officials and African leaders on a crowded boat.On the sidelines of the naval parade, he greeted the Gorelov family from Magadan, in Russia\u2019s far east. The parents a day earlier had received the Order of Parental Glory for raising 10 children, part of a long-running Russian state effort to combat demographic decline by promoting \u201cmulti-child families.\u201dMr. Putin slipped in between the seven children the Gorelovs had brought for a photograph.In recent days, Mr. Putin has alternated between appearances that address the war and interactions with crowds that seem designed to communicate normalcy and demonstrate that he broadly retains the population\u2019s loyalty, even as the war causes continued hardship that has fueled discontent for many Russians.On Wednesday, he appeared before widows whose husbands had died in the war, brushing his hand over the head of a fallen soldier\u2019s young daughter and patting the shoulder of the boy next to her.ImageMembers of the public waved as Mr. Putin and the Russian defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, passed by on a boat while reviewing a naval parade during celebrations in St. Petersburg last month.Credit...Anatoly Maltsev/EPA, via ShutterstockBy the standards of most world politicians, Mr. Putin\u2019s encounters with crowds are still limited. Mr. Zelensky, by comparison, follows a schedule packed with public interactions. A busy American presidential candidate might interact with more public crowds in a week than Mr. Putin has in the past year.But by the Russian leader\u2019s recent standards, the change is noticeable.Sam Greene, director for democratic resilience at the Center for European Policy Analysis in Washington, said that Mr. Putin might be ramping up his public activity before the presidential election next March. It will be the Russian leader\u2019s fifth, though he has yet to announce his candidacy officially.With a system that has neutralized competitors over the years, Mr. Putin will undoubtedly win, but the Kremlin will still monitor turnout and victory margins \u2014 as will the Russian elite Mr. Putin must keep on side.\u201cYou\u2019ve got all of these oligarchs and people throughout the system who are rich and powerful and unaccountable \u2014 and that is all made possible by the fact that you\u2019ve got somebody up on the stage who is keeping the show going,\u201d Mr. Greene said. \u201cHe needs to communicate to the elite that not only is he good at doing that \u2014 but it\u2019s not even close.\u201dPaul Sonne is a foreign correspondent for The Times, focusing on Russia and Ukraine.

of\n        July 30th.The Cooking NewsletterRecipes That Meet You Where You AreBy Sam SiftonGood morning. I came down with Covid for the second time last week, and it left me shivering, sweating, panting a little, unable to sleep, unable to get out of bed. I watched things on my screens. I drank a lot of Gatorade and swallowed my dose of Paxlovid in the mornings and at night. I ate little. I kept panic about my breathlessness at bay. It was not a good time.I thought a lot about what I was going to cook, and eat, once I got better. These were spacey fever dreams. High on the list: Bryan Washington\u2019s new recipe for chilaquiles verdes (above), which he wrote about for The New York Times Magazine.What I love about the recipe, and about Bryan\u2019s cooking in general, is his understanding of how recipes aren\u2019t rules so much as guideposts, ways of thinking about dishes that can mutate over time, perhaps because of circumstance or taste. There are a thousand ways to make chilaquiles, after all, and in Bryan\u2019s view, the best way is the way the dish was prepared the last time he ate it. \u201cLike so much of cooking\u2019s calculus,\u201d he said, \u201cchilaquiles are as much about feel as about measurements and instructions.\u201d______Featured RecipeChilaquiles VerdesView Recipe \u2192______So attend to his recipe, and make it your own. Excellent tortillas help, as does time spent making the salsa verde with care. But I\u2019ll tell you what: You could make chilaquiles with store-bought tortilla chips and a jar of your favorite salsa verde (mine\u2019s from Herdez) and feel a wonderment, especially if you\u2019ve been laid low and are just trying to find a sense of the delicious.Then keep it up. I\u2019d like to make our recipe for the best chicken salad this weekend, for lunches next week, and kimchi carbonara for Saturday night, if not clam fritters and coleslaw. Some have asked if they can use canned chopped clams for those fritters. You can, but before you do, see if your fishmonger has frozen chopped clams \u2014 the true middle ground between fresh and preserved.And grilled chicken with tomatoes and corn for dinner on Sunday night? I\u2019d like that, though if I\u2019ve got the energy (I\u2019m still a little shaky!), I\u2019d almost prefer a celery Victor salad, with cold slices of watermelon for dessert.There are many thousands more recipes to cook this weekend, waiting for you on New York Times Cooking, at least if you have a subscription. Subscriptions support our work and make it possible to continue. I hope if you haven\u2019t taken one out already, that you will subscribe today. Thank you.If you run into problems with our technology, please reach out for help: cookingcare@NYTimes.com. Someone will get back to you. Or if you\u2019d like to lodge a complaint or offer a compliment to one of our hard-working staff members, you can write to me: foodeditor@NYTimes.com. I can\u2019t respond to every letter. I get a lot of them. But I do read every one I receive.Now, it has nothing to do with beurre blanc or ripe blackberries, but after I rewatched Michael Mann\u2019s 1995 thriller, \u201cHeat,\u201d with a 103-degree fever, his novel \u201cHeat 2\u201d made a lot more sense to me. (I caught the film on Netflix; it\u2019s on other streaming services as well.)Are you caught up on Steven Soderbergh\u2019s \u201cFull Circle\u201d on Max? Y\u2019oughta get on that. It took me down a Soderbergh rabbit hole to his excellent \u201cCommand Z,\u201d written with Kurt Andersen, on their very own website.Finally, here\u2019s my anthem this week, the song that kept me going: \u201cStill Getting It Done,\u201d from Ghost of Vroom. I\u2019ll see you on Sunday.Read MoreEggplant ParmesanEric Kim1 hour 35 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.Soy-Glazed Salmon Hand RollsKay Chun30 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easySheet-Pan Chicken Thighs With Spicy CornMelissa Clark55 minutes, plus at least 30 minutes\u2019 marinatingSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyBlistered Broccoli Pasta With Walnuts, Pecorino and MintDawn Perry15 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyTomato Cheddar ToastsAli Slagle10 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.Pork Ribs AdoboJulia Moskin, Amy Besa, Romy Dorotan1 hour 30 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyChilled Zucchini Soup With Lemon and BasilHetty Lui McKinnon15 minutes, plus optional chillingSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyPeach CrispYossy ArefiAbout 2 hoursSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyChilaquiles VerdesBryan Washington20 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.Best Chicken SaladJulia Moskin20 minutes, plus 2 hours' resting and 4 hours' chillingSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.Kimchi CarbonaraElyse Inamine, Melanie Hye Jin Meyer25 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyColeslawKay Chun10 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyCoconut-Dill Salmon With Green Beans and CornYewande Komolafe40 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyGrilled Pork Chops With Plum BBQ SauceEric Kim30 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyBaked Feta Dip With Spicy Tomatoes and HoneyMelissa Clark1 hour 20 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.Nonalcoholic Dirty Lemon TonicRebekah Peppler5 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.Moka Dupont: A French Icebox CakeDorie Greenspan30 minutes, plus at least 3 hours chillingSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyOvernight OatsGenevieve Ko5 minutes, plus overnight soakingSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.Slow Cooker Chipotle-Honey Chicken TacosSarah DiGregorio3 to 5 hoursSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.healthyThai-Style Crunchy Vegetable SaladKay Chun20 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.See all recipes Recipes We Think You\u2019ll LoveDishes recommended for you based on what you\u2019ve savedTrending RecipesMore From Our EditorsWeeknight dinners, seasonal favorites and other ideas for this week.Summer Tomato RecipesTomato BruschettaAli Slagle15 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easySheet-Pan Baked Feta With Broccolini, Tomatoes and LemonYasmin Fahr25 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyBasil and Tomato Fried RiceHetty Lui McKinnon15 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyDumpling Tomato Salad With Chile Crisp VinaigretteHetty Lui McKinnon20 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easySesame Tomato SaladKay Chun20 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyHot Dogs With Pico de GalloGenevieve Ko, Tanya Sichynsky30 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyJuicy Tomatoes With Parmesan-Olive Bread CrumbsChristian Reynoso40 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyClassic Caprese SaladMelissa Clark15 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyBest GazpachoJulia Moskin20 minutes plus chilling timeSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.Cold Tofu Salad With Tomatoes and PeachesHana Asbrink20 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyMarinated Mozzarella, Olives and Cherry TomatoesDavid Tanis20 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyGrilled Chicken With Tomatoes and CornAli Slagle30 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyTuna and Tomato SaladAli Slagle20 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.easyPuttanesca Chickpea-Tomato SaladAli Slagle15 minutesSave to Recipe BoxLog in or sign up to save this recipe.Kachumbari (Tomato and Onion Relish)Kayla Stewart, Michael W.

The charges are novel applications of criminal laws to unprecedented circumstances, heightening legal risks, but Mr. Smith\u2019s tactic gives him multiple paths in obtaining and upholding a guilty verdict.\u201cEspecially in a case like this, you want to have multiple charges that are applicable or provable with the same evidence, so that if on appeal you lose one, you still have the conviction,\u201d said Julie O\u2019Sullivan, a Georgetown University law professor and former federal prosecutor.That structure in the indictment is only one of several strategic choices by Mr. Smith \u2014 including what facts and potential charges he chose to include or omit \u2014 that may foreshadow and shape how an eventual trial of Mr. Trump will play out.The four charges rely on three criminal statutes: a count of conspiring to defraud the government, another of conspiring to disenfranchise voters, and two counts related to corruptly obstructing a congressional proceeding. Applying each to Mr. Trump\u2019s actions raises various complexities, according to a range of criminal law experts.At the same time, the indictment hints at how Mr. Smith is trying to sidestep legal pitfalls and potential defenses. He began with an unusual preamble that reads like an opening statement at trial, acknowledging that Mr. Trump had a right to challenge the election results in court and even to lie about them, but drawing a distinction with the defendant\u2019s pursuit of \u201cunlawful means of discounting legitimate votes and subverting the election results.\u201dWhile the indictment is sprawling in laying out a case against Mr. Trump, it brings a selective lens on the multifaceted efforts by the former president and his associates to overturn the 2020 election.\u201cThe strength of the indictment is that it is very narrowly written,\u201d said Ronald S. Sullivan Jr., a Harvard Law School professor and former public defender. \u201cThe government is not attempting to prove too much, but rather it went for low-hanging fruit.\u201dFor one, Mr. Smith said little about the violent events of Jan. 6, leaving out vast amounts of evidence in the report by a House committee that separately investigated the matter. He focused more on a brazen plan to recruit false slates of electors from swing states and a pressure campaign on Vice President Mike Pence to block the congressional certification of Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s victory.That choice dovetails with Mr. Smith\u2019s decision not to charge Mr. Trump with inciting an insurrection or seditious conspiracy \u2014 potential charges the House committee recommended. By eschewing them, he avoided having the case focus on the inflammatory but occasionally ambiguous remarks Mr. Trump made to his supporters as they morphed into a mob, avoiding tough First Amendment objections that defense lawyers could raise.For another, while Mr. Smith described six of Mr. Trump\u2019s associates as co-conspirators, none were charged. It remains unclear whether some of them will eventually be indicted if they do not cooperate, or whether he intends to target only Mr. Trump so the case will move faster.ImageMr. Smith chose to say very little about the violent events of Jan. 6 and instead focused on the scheme to recruit slates of fake electors and the pressure Mr. Trump brought upon Vice President Pence.Credit...Jason Andrew for The New York TimesAmong the charges Mr. Smith did bring against Mr. Trump, corrupt obstruction of an official proceeding is the most familiar in how it applies to the aftermath of the 2020 election. Already, hundreds of ordinary Jan. 6 rioters have been charged with it.To date, most judges in Jan. 6 cases, at the district court and appeals court level, have upheld the use of the statute. But a few Trump-appointed judges have favored a more narrow interpretation, like limiting the law to situations in which people destroyed evidence or sought a benefit more concrete than having their preferred candidate win an election.Mr. Trump, of course, would have personally benefited from staying in office, making that charge stronger against him than against the rioters. Still, a possible risk is if the Supreme Court soon takes up one of the rioter cases and then narrows the scope of the law in a way that would affect the case against Mr. Trump.Proving IntentSome commentators have argued in recent days that prosecutors must persuade the jury that Mr. Trump knew his voter fraud claims were false to prove corrupt intent. But that is oversimplified, several experts said.To be sure, experts broadly agree that Mr. Smith will have an easier time winning a conviction if jurors are persuaded that Mr. Trump knew he was lying about everything. To that end, the indictment details how he \u201cwas notified repeatedly that his claims were untrue\u201d and \u201cdeliberately disregarded the truth.\u201d\u201cWhat you see in Trump \u2014 a guy who seems to inhabit his own fictional universe \u2014 is something you see in other fraud defendants,\u201d said David Alan Sklansky, a Stanford University law professor. \u201cIt\u2019s a common challenge in a fraud case to prove that at some level the defendant knew what he was telling people wasn\u2019t true. The way you prove it is, in part, by showing that lots of people made clear to the defendant that what he was saying was baseless.\u201dMoreover, the indictment emphasizes several episodes in which Mr. Trump had firsthand knowledge that his statements were false. Prosecutors can use those instances to urge jurors to infer that Mr. Trump knew he was lying about everything else, too.The indictment, for example, recounts a taped call on Jan. 2 with Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, in which Mr. Trump shared a series of conspiracy theories that Mr. Raffensperger systematically debunked in detail. But on Twitter the next day, Mr. Trump \u201cfalsely claimed that the Georgia secretary of state had not addressed\u201d the allegations.And on Jan. 5, Mr. Pence told Mr. Trump that he had no lawful authority to alter or delay the counting of Mr. Biden\u2019s electoral votes, but \u201chours later\u201d Mr. Trump issued a statement through his campaign saying the opposite: \u201cThe vice president and I are in total agreement that the vice president has the power to act.\u201dImageVice President Pence appears during House committee hearings investigating Jan. 6. The indictment suggests Mr. Trump knew he was lying about what Mr. Pence had told him on January 5.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesIn any case, several rioters have already argued that they did not have \u201ccorrupt intent\u201d because they sincerely believed the election had been stolen. That has not worked: Judges have said that corrupt intent can be shown by engaging in other unlawful actions like trespassing, assaulting the police and destroying property.\u201cBelief that your actions are serving a greater good does not negate consciousness of wrongdoing,\u201d Judge Royce C. Lamberth wrote last month.Mr. Trump, of course, did not rampage through the Capitol. But the indictment accuses him of committing other crimes \u2014 the fraud and voter disenfranchisement conspiracies \u2014 based on wrongful conduct. It cites Mr. Trump\u2019s bid to use fake electors in violation of the Electoral Count Act and his solicitation of fraud at the Justice Department and in Georgia, where he pressured Mr. Raffensperger to help him \u201cfind\u201d 11,780 votes, enough to overcome Mr. Biden\u2019s margin of victory.\u201cWhether he thinks he won or lost is relevant but not determinative,\u201d said Paul Rosenzweig, a former prosecutor who worked on the independent counsel investigation into President Bill Clinton. \u201cTrump could try to achieve vindicating his beliefs legally. The conspiracy is tied to the illegal means. So he has to say that he thought \u2018finding\u2019 11,000 votes was legal, or that fake electors were legal. That is much harder to say with a straight face.\u201dProving Mr. Trump\u2019s intent will also be key to the charges of defrauding the government and disenfranchising voters. But it may be easier because those laws do not have the heightened standard of \u201ccorrupt\u201d intent as the obstruction statute does.Court rulings interpreting the statute that criminalizes defrauding the United States, for example, have established that evidence of deception or dishonesty is sufficient. In a 1924 Supreme Court ruling, Chief Justice William H. Taft wrote that it covers interference with a government function \u201cby deceit, craft or trickery, or at least by means that are dishonest.\u201d A 1989 appeals court ruling said the dishonest actions need not be crimes in and of themselves.This factor may help explain the indictment\u2019s emphasis on the fake electors schemes in one state after another, a repetitive narrative that risks dullness: It would be hard to credibly argue that Mr. Trump and his co-conspirators thought the fake slates they submitted were real, and the indictment accuses them of other forms of trickery as well.ImageThe opening of the Michigan Electoral College session at the State Capitol in 2020.

Unlike the other charges, it had not been a major part of the public discussion of the investigation \u2014 for example, it was not among the charges recommended by the House Jan. 6 committee.Congress enacted the law after the Civil War to provide a tool for federal prosecutors to go after Southern white people, including Ku Klux Klan members, who used terrorism to prevent formerly enslaved Black people from voting. But in the 20th century, the Supreme Court upheld a broadened use of the law to address election-fraud conspiracies. The idea is that any conspiracy to engineer dishonest election results victimizes all voters in an election.\u201cIt was a good move to charge that statute, partly because that is really what this case really is about \u2014 depriving the people of the right to choose their president,\u201d said Robert S. Litt, a former federal prosecutor and a top intelligence lawyer in the Obama administration.That statute has mostly been used to address misconduct leading up to and during an election, like bribing voters or stuffing ballot boxes, rather than misconduct after an election. Still, in 1933, an appeals court upheld its use in a case involving people who reported false totals from a voter tabulation machine.It has never been used before in a conspiracy to use fake slates of Electoral College voters from multiple states to keep legitimate electors from being counted and thereby subvert the results of a presidential election \u2014 a situation that itself was unprecedented.Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers have signaled they will argue that he had a First Amendment right to say whatever he wanted. Indeed, the indictment acknowledged that it was not illegal in and of itself for Mr. Trump to lie.But in portraying Mr. Trump\u2019s falsehoods as \u201cintegral to his criminal plans,\u201d Mr. Smith suggested he would frame those public statements as contributing to unlawful actions and as evidence they were undertaken with bad intentions, not as crimes in and of themselves.ImageMr. Trump at Reagan National Airport Thursday following his court appearance. Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team has signaled they will argue that he had a First Amendment right to say whatever he wanted.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesA related defense Mr. Trump may raise is the issue of \u201cadvice of counsel.\u201d If a defendant relied in good faith on a lawyer who incorrectly informed him that doing something would be legal, a jury may decide he lacked criminal intent. But there are limits. Among them, the defendant must have told the lawyer all the relevant facts, and the theory must be \u201creasonable.\u201dThe indictment discusses how even though White House lawyers told Mr. Trump that Mr. Pence had no lawful authority to overturn Mr. Biden\u2019s victory, an outside lawyer \u2014 John Eastman, described in the indictment as Co-Conspirator 2 and who separately faces disbarment proceedings \u2014 advised him that Mr. Pence could.Several legal specialists agreed that Mr. Trump has an advice-of-counsel argument to make. But Samuel W. Buell, a Duke University law professor, said Mr. Smith was likely to try to rebut it by pointing to the repeated instances in which Mr. Trump\u2019s White House legal advisers told him that Mr. Eastman was wrong.\u201cYou have to have a genuine good-faith belief that the legal advice is legitimate and valid, not just \u2018I\u2019m going to keep running through as many lawyers as I can until one tells me something I want to hear, no matter how crazy and implausible it is,\u2019\u201d Mr. Buell said.Charlie Savage is a Washington-based national security and legal policy correspondent.

Trump\u2019s growing cast of lawyers is marked by a web of overlapping interests encompassing witnesses, co-defendants and potential targets.Give this articleBy Alan Feuer,\u00a0Ben Protess and Maggie HabermanAug. 5, 2023Updated 11:59 a.m. ETM. Evan Corcoran, a lawyer who accompanied former President Donald J. Trump to court this week for his arraignment on charges of trying to overturn the 2020 election, has given crucial evidence in Mr. Trump\u2019s other federal case \u2014 the one accusing him of illegally hoarding classified documents.Another lawyer close to Mr. Trump, Boris Epshteyn, sat for an interview with prosecutors this spring and could be one of the former president\u2019s co-conspirators in the election tampering case.And Mr. Epshteyn\u2019s lawyer, Todd Blanche, is defending Mr. Trump against both the documents and election case indictments.The legal team that Mr. Trump has assembled to represent him in the twin prosecutions by the special counsel, Jack Smith, is marked by a tangled web of potential conflicts and overlapping interests \u2014 so much so that Mr. Smith\u2019s office has started asking questions.While it is not uncommon for lawyers in complex matters \u2014 like large mob cases or financial inquiries \u2014 to wear many hats or to play competing roles, the Gordian knot of intertwined imperatives in the Trump investigations is particularly intricate and insular.Some of the lawyers involved in the cases are representing both charged defendants and uncharged witnesses. At least one could eventually become a defendant, and another could end up as a witness in one case and Mr. Trump\u2019s defender in a different one.All of that sits atop another thorny fact: Many of the lawyers are being paid by Save America PAC, Mr. Trump\u2019s political action committee, which has itself been under government scrutiny for months. Some of the witnesses those lawyers represent work for the Trump Organization, Mr. Trump\u2019s company, but their legal defense has not been arranged by the company, but rather by Mr. Trump\u2019s own legal team, a person with knowledge of the matter said.Although clients might choose to stick with their lawyers despite a conflict, just this week, prosecutors under Mr. Smith sent up a warning flare about these issues. They asked Judge Aileen M. Cannon, who is overseeing the documents case, to conduct a hearing \u201cregarding potential conflicts\u201d arising from the complex client list of one lawyer, Stanley Woodward Jr.Mr. Woodward represents Walt Nauta, Mr. Trump\u2019s personal aide and one of his co-defendants in the documents case. Mr. Woodward has also worked for at least three witnesses in the broader inquiry who could be called to testify at trial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStanley Woodward Jr.\nLAWYER\n\n\nIs a lawyer for ...\n\n\nIs also a lawyer for ...\n\n\nWalt Nauta\nCo-defendant\n\n\nThree witnesses\n\n\nDonald J.

Trump\ndefendant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of those witnesses, Yuscil Taveras, an information technology worker at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump\u2019s private club and residence in Florida, recently provided prosecutors with potentially incriminating information about Mr. Nauta after parting ways with Mr. Woodward and getting a new lawyer.In a motion to Judge Cannon filed on Wednesday, prosecutors said that given all of this, Mr. Woodward could have \u201cdivided loyalties\u201d and asked the judge to inform Mr. Woodward\u2019s clients about the \u201cpotential risks\u201d they face.Prosecutors appear to have similar qualms about another lawyer in the documents case, John Irving, who represents Carlos De Oliveira, Mr. Trump\u2019s other co-defendant, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Irving\u2019s client list also includes three witnesses who were interviewed by investigators and could, in theory, end up on the stand.Mr. Woodward has signaled that he will not contest the need to hold a hearing. And he and Mr. Irving, both of whom declined to comment, disclosed the potential conflicts to their clients early on, informing them that there could come a point when they would need new lawyers, according to people familiar with the matter.In a statement, Steven Cheung, a spokesman for Mr. Trump, argued that it would be normal for the judge to hold a hearing to consider the potential conflicts, describing it as \u201ccommonplace\u201d in such a broad case.\u201cThere is nothing unusual or concerning about any court confirming that President Trump and others are aware of any potential waivable conflicts issues, of which they all are certainly already aware,\u201d he said. \u201cAny attempt to read into this or otherwise guess about the president\u2019s legal strategy is ridiculous and sad.\u201dStill, the complexities surrounding the case are extensive and have raised concerns for prosecutors.\u201cThis is boundary breaking,\u201d Bruce Green, who teaches legal ethics at Fordham Law School in New York, said about the totality of the issues involved. \u201cWhat I\u2019m most curious about is why these lawyers want to play so many roles. Usually, lawyers just want to be lawyers.\u201dThe potential conflicts confronting the lawyers in Mr. Trump\u2019s prosecutions come from a variety of sources.Some involve situations in which the lawyers could be put in the untenable position of cross-examining a former client in the service of defending a current one. Others stem from bumping up against the guardrails put in place to keep lawyers from advocating for their clients with one hand while possibly incriminating them with the other.Then there is the issue of the lawyers\u2019 bills largely being paid by Mr. Trump\u2019s political action committee. That situation, said Stephen Gillers, a legal ethics professor at New York University, was theoretically not all that unusual. Organizations often foot the bill for employees who need legal representation resulting from \u201cthe scope of their employment,\u201d he said.Still, Mr. Gillers said, problems can arise when the entity paying the fees chooses or steers a lawyer toward a client and that lawyer has competing loyalties when it comes to the payer and the client\u2019s best interests.Many potential objections to conflicts in these cases could be waived by the clients or otherwise mitigated by the courts, Mr. Green said. But he cautioned that judges often lean toward avoiding conflicts at all costs \u2014 up to and including disqualifying lawyers who face them \u2014 because the consequences of allowing them to continue could result in the dismissal of the case.One of the most awkward situations in a Trump-related case came on Thursday when the former president was accompanied to his arraignment on election interference charges by Mr. Corcoran, a lawyer who had worked with him before on both that matter and the documents case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM.

Trump\nDEFENDANT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr. Corcoran\u2019s presence in the courtroom was somewhat unexpected because five months ago a federal judge had ordered him to provide Mr. Smith with the extensive audio notes he made about his work for Mr. Trump. The recorded notes were handed over after the judge determined that Mr. Trump had likely misled Mr. Corcoran and tried to use his legal services to commit a crime \u2014 an exception to the attorney-client privilege that would normally protect such recordings.The audio notes, in which Mr. Corcoran described assisting Mr. Trump to comply with a subpoena that demanded all of the classified materials in his possession, played a central role in the indictment that was filed in June accusing Mr. Trump of illegally retaining more than 30 sensitive documents after leaving office.The notes laid out in detail how Mr. Trump pressured Mr. Corcoran to prevent investigators from reclaiming classified material, according to the indictment, suggesting that he \u201chide or destroy documents called for by the grand jury subpoena.\u201dProsecutors are likely to call Mr. Corcoran as a witness at Mr. Trump\u2019s documents trial in Florida, even as he might continue to assist the former president\u2019s defense team on the election case in Washington, people with knowledge of the matter have said. Mr. Smith\u2019s prosecutors have inquired about Mr. Corcoran\u2019s role in the election case, but have not yet signaled that they plan to object to it.Although he was in court on Thursday, Mr. Corcoran has not formally appeared on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf in the case. And if there were a conflict, Mr. Trump could choose to waive potential objections to it. It is unclear why Mr. Trump, who prizes loyalty, would continue to want Mr. Corcoran\u2019s assistance.But it could be part of a long-shot challenge to the so-called crime-fraud exception that permitted the notes to be handed over in the documents case.\u201cThere is a rule called the advocate-witness rule that forbids lawyers from occupying both roles, and Trump may believe it will be easier to keep Corcoran off the stand and to exclude his grand jury testimony if he remains on the trial team,\u201d Mr. Gillers said.A different twist emerged on Tuesday when the election case indictment was handed up in Washington. The charges mentioned six co-conspirators who helped Mr. Trump to execute his plans. One of them \u2014 Co-Conspirator 6 \u2014 was described as a \u201cpolitical consultant\u201d who assisted Mr. Trump in what has become known as the \u201cfake electors\u201d scheme.While prosecutors have not identified Co-Conspirator 6, an email obtained by The New York Times suggests that it could be Mr. Epshteyn, a lawyer and strategic adviser to Mr. Trump who was paid for political consulting in 2020 and who has served throughout the recent investigations as one of his top advisers and his in-house counsel. The email\u2019s contents and its recipient \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s former lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who is Co-Conspirator 1 in the indictment \u2014 match that of an email described in the indictment as sent by Co-Conspirator 6.It would be an uncomfortable development, to say the least, if Mr. Epshteyn, who often travels with the former president and accompanied him to his arraignment on Thursday, was also an unnamed, unindicted participant in the case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTodd Blanche\nLAWYER\n\n\nBoris Epshteyn\nLAWYER\n\n\nIs a lawyer for...\n\n\nIs in-house\ncounsel for ...\n\n\nWas a possible\nco-conspirator in the\nJan. 6 case with ...\n\n\nIs a lawyer in the Jan. 6\nand classified documents\ncases for ...\n\n\nDonald J.

Trump\nDEFENDANT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is also the fact that Mr. Ephsteyn\u2019s lawyer, Mr. Blanche, is a lawyer for Mr. Trump and is representing the former president not only in the two cases brought by Mr. Smith, but also in a case brought by the Manhattan district attorney. In that case, Mr. Trump has been accused of 34 felonies stemming from a hush payment to a porn actress in the run-up to the 2016 election.Mr. Ephsteyn hired Mr. Blanche last year before any of the cases against Mr. Trump had been filed. Mr. Blanche declined to comment.Photo credits: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters (M. Evan Corcoran); Alex Brandon/Election 2024 Pence, via Associated Press (Donald J.
